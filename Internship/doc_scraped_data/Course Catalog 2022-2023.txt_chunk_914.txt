Students/teams select a project, develop an understanding of the project scope that
includes research and documentation of related work, prepare a feasibility study,
develop project requirements (constraints) and engineering, software, and/or security
specifications, propose solutions and multiple designs, analyze proposed designs,
select a final proposed design, and prepare and present a preliminary design review
(PDR). Students are expected to apply proper systems engineering and project
management to their work. Additional components may be required in some projects.
Students/teams submit a final report at the end of the semester. Pre-requisite: Senior
standing. (3-0-3)
IAE-458 - Senior Design Project II
Students/teams build and test their selected designs (completed in IAE-457). Each
student team delivers a tested prototype and defends its project in front of a panel of
experts. Students/teams submit a final report that includes description of the design,
realization, and test processes as well as test results, discussion, and conclusion.
Failure to deliver a completed design and a working prototype that meets engineering,
