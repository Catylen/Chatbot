CAPITOL TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY

Courses

MA-360 - Laplace and Fourier Analysis

MAF-810 - Manufacturing Research Methodologies
The student will evaluate and develop research methodologies and strategies suitable
for Manufacturing and address the data sources and information to test a hypothesis or
research question. It is expected the student will be building upon MAF-800 in refining
and developing their research task and plan. (6)
MAF-820 - Manufacturing Future Demands
The student will research the future demands on a regional, national and global level
and how these influence the specific research questions and demands. Data collection
and applications will be central to evaluating the needs of Manufacturing on the short,
medium and long term. (6)
MAF-830 - Strategies for Manufacturing
The student will undertake a robust and comprehensive analysis of the strategies for
preparation, protection, and resilience of Manufacturing. Students will be introduced
to the influences of economics and politics that dictate manufacturing planning based
upon non-technical aspects and requirements (e.g., how noise pollution dictates design
and efficiency as well as operations). (6)
