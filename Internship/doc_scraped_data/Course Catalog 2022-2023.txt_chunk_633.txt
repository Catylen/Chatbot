CRI-210 - Critical Infrastructure I
This course will introduce participants to the key terms, policy, guidance, and
preparedness efforts required to safeguard the Nationâ€™s critical infrastructure. Students
will learn relevant policy and guidance, discuss the risk management framework,
describe Federal critical infrastructure security and resilience and information sharing
programs, and relate critical infrastructure programs to individual actions. Primary
focus will be on incorporating Critical Infrastructure protection in to construction
of facilities in six of the sixteen critical infrastructure sectors: chemical facilities,
commercial (e.g., retail, entertainment, lodging), communications facilities, critical
manufacturing facilities, dams, and energy facilities. Students will complete hands-on
Critical Infrastructure projects related to the construction of those types of facilities.
