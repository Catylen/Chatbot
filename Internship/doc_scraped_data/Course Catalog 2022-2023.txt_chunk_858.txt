healthcare field overall. The student will identify areas for improvements and failings.
The faculty will directly support and mentor the exploration phase of the planning. (6)
HCS-810 - Healthcare Cybersecurity Research Methods
Under a Chair and committee, a student will continue evaluating the Healthcare
Cybersecurity field. The student will also develop research methodologies and
strategies suitable for understanding Healthcare Cybersecurity. The student will address
the data sources, information, and intelligence to test a hypothesis or research question.
It is expected the student will be building upon HCS-800 in refining and developing their
research task and plan. (6)
HCS-820 - Healthcare Cybersecurity Future Demands
Under a Chair and committee, a student will further research the future demands in the
Healthcare Cybersecurity field and how these influence specific research questions.
Data collection and applications will be central to evaluating the needs of Healthcare
Cybersecurity in the short, medium, and long term. The literature review will be more
specific in focus and direction at this stage. (6)
