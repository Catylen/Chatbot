Bachelor’s Degrees
Astronautical Engineering (BS)

Students study space systems engineering, orbital mechanics, spacecraft subsystems,
spacecraft attitude and control, autonomous ground systems, as well as other areas of
satellite mission planning, design and operations. Graduates have the ability to work on
multidisciplinary teams, meet the expectations of employers of astronautical engineers,
and pursue an advanced degree, if desired. All students will complete a capstone in
which they propose, design, develop and deliver a satellite mission plan or other spacerelated project.
The Bachelor of Science in Astronautical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering
Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
