An introduction to the design and control of autonomous robots. Mechanical
considerations, detection and navigational ability are discovered in this course. Students
will develop algorithms and use machine learning techniques to generate programs
to control electromechanical systems to perform tasks. The class incorporates teambased projects and laboratories. Prerequisites: EL-262, ROB-300. (3-0-3)
RSC-802 - Fundamentals of Doctoral Learning
Doctoral programs educate students for highly specialized careers in academe or
practice. Students of doctoral level programs are taught the ability to create knowledge
through original research in their areas of specialization. This course will orient new
doctoral students to learning at the doctoral level and prepare them for the entire
program of study. Students will each develop a Doctoral Learning Contract (DLC) that
will serve as guides through graduation. (6)
RSC-810 - Professional Research Theory & Practice I
Students will examine the research process in the context of quantitative and qualitative
methods. Students will develop a purpose statement, problem statement, and research
question. (3)
