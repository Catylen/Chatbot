Center of Cybersecurity Research and Analysis (CCRA)
The Center for Cybersecurity Research and Analysis serves as the university hub for
training, research, analysis, and programming in all things cybersecurity. Learn to defeat
simulated cyberattacks, land an internship where you can put your skills to work and
prepare for the workforce, publish a scholarly article addressing an existing challenge
in the field, and much more. Students–both on-ground and online–faculty, alumni, and
community partners alike are welcome.
As one of the first schools in the nation to be designated a National Center of
Excellence in Cyber Defense by the Department of Homeland Security and National
Security Agency, Capitol Technology University stands ready to advance the field and do
its part to combat one of the nation’s greatest challenges.
