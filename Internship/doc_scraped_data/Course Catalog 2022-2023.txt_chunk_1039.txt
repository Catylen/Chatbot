demands and explore specific research questions. Data collection and applications will
be central to evaluating military leaders’ needs in the short, medium, and long term. The
literature review will be more specific in focus and direction at this stage. (6)
MIL-830 - Strategies for Military Leadership
Under the Chair/Committee’s direction, the student will undertake a robust and
comprehensive analysis of the strategies for the growth and evolution of military
leadership. The student’s topic will gain a definitive direction. The student will develop a
draft methodology. The student’s Chair/Committee will review both to ensure the topic’s
scope is not too broad and the draft methodology is appropriate. (6)
MIL-840 - Military Leadership Research Proposal
The student will produce a research proposal that is comprehensive in detail and
planning. The research proposal will address the research topic, general problem,
specific problem, purpose, research questions, limitations, delimitations, and timing
plan. The doctoral student will then complete the research milestones according to
the proposal and research plan. The student must gain IRB and ARB approvals by this
stage. (6)
