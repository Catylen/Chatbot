The student will focus on the study of the latest counterterrorism strategies, tactics and
developments. The student will synthesize the growing effect of counterterrorism on
current operations, international relationships and effects on the field, and where there
are areas of improvements or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas for
research at a later stage and explore the background of counterterrorism. The faculty
will directly support and mentor the exploration phase of the planning. (6)
CTR-810 - Counterterrorism Research Methodologies
Under a Chair and committee, a student will continue evaluating and develop research
methodologies and strategies suitable for understanding counterterrorism and address
the data sources, information, and intelligence to test a hypothesis or research question.
It is expected the student will be building upon CTR-800 in refining and developing their
research task and plan. (6)
CTR-820 - Counterterrorism Future Demands
Under a Chair and committee, a student will research the future demands in the
counterterrorism field and how these influence specific research questions. Data
