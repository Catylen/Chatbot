The student will continue to evaluate and develop research methodologies and
strategies suitable for understanding Quantum Computing and address the data
sources, information, and intelligence to test a hypothesis or research question. It is
expected the student will be building upon CSQ-800 in refining and developing their
research task and plan. (6)
CSQ-820 - Quantum Computing Future Demands
The student will define the research and future demands in the Quantum Computing
industry and how these influence specific research questions. Data collection and
applications will be central to evaluating the needs of Quantum Computing on the short,
medium and long term. The studentâ€™s Chair will be guiding and supporting at all stages.
Working with the Chair they will complete an Academic Review Board document for
submitting to the approval stage. (6)
CSQ-830 - Strategies for Quantum Computing
The student will undertake a robust and comprehensive analysis of the strategies for
the growth and evolution of the Quantum Computing industry. Students will analyze
the influences of technology, economics, international politics, and sustainability that
