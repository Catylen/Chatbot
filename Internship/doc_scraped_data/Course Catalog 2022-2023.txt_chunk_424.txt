Sustainability (PhD)
The PhD in Sustainability degree is a unique program designed to meet the longstanding needs of managing our resources efficiently, effectively and with sustainability.
This degree is not an environmental science degree or environmental in focus. The
focus is technology in using science and technology is reducing resource demand,
the reliability of what we use and the engineering to deliver on real improvements.
Currently wind turbine blades only are usable for 10 years, then buried until a solution
of how to recycle material is not able to be used with current knowledge. Sustainable
means designing turbine blades to last considerably longer, using materials that can be
recycled and supporting a net zero carbon environment.
