IE-707 - Network Architecture Convergence Using Wireless
This course investigates the techniques used by successful network engineers to create
converged network architectures and provide optimum information access to their
users. The course will provide an in-depth study of the current and contemplated mobile
technologies that can facilitate network convergence. Students will test these mobile
technologies and their applications via the virtual laboratory concept using OpNet, the
most advanced network modeling software currently available. Technical information
on specific equipment and software will be provided as instruction supplemental to the
textbook, and case studies will be used throughout the course. (3)
