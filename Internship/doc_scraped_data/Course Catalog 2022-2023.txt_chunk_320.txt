engineering principles to create software and hardware solutions. Students study
modern programming languages, algorithm development, software design and testing,
as well as computer organization and architecture, micro-controller system design,
programmable chip technology, and knowledge acquisition using UML. All students will
complete a capstone in which they propose, design, build, test and deliver a working
software application.
