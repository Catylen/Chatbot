Independent Study
Independent study in a course will be granted only in the most extraordinary
circumstances. Eligibility for an independent study course will be determined by
a committee comprised of academic department chairs, academic advisors and
academic support staff. If the committee determines that a student is eligible for an
independent study course, the appropriate department chair will assign a professor
and the student will be registered for the course by the Office of Registration and
Records. The assigned professor will organize all course requirements including exams,
homework, lab assignments and research papers in lieu of classroom participation.
Students interested in an independent study course should submit an independent
study request form to the Office of Registration and Records.
