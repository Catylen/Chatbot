the same through viva voce (i.e., oral examination). The studentâ€™s Chair, Committee and
DBA Review Board will confer to determine if the student has provided a sufficient and
necessary final oral defense of the research. (6)
SCS-800 - Space Cybersecurity Research Background
The student will focus on the study of the latest Space Cybersecurity strategies,
tactics developments, and technology. The student will synthesize the growing need
for upgraded Space Cybersecurity on current and future operations in the field and
identify areas for improvement or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas for
research and explore the background of Space Cybersecurity. The faculty will directly
support and mentor the exploration phase of the planning. (6)
SCS-810 - Space Cybersecurity Research Methodologies
Under a Chair and Committee, the student will continue evaluating and develop
research methodologies and strategies suitable for understanding Space Cybersecurity
and address the data sources, information, and intelligence to test a hypothesis or
research question, The student is expected to be building upon SCS-800 in refining and
developing their research task and plan. (6)
