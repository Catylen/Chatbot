Academic Dismissal
After a second suspension, undergraduate students who have been readmitted
to Capitol Technology University after completing 18 credits at another institution
must earn a 2.0 GPA each semester. If their GPA falls below 2.0 at any time, they
will be dismissed and not permitted to return to Capitol Technology University.
Graduate students who fail to reach the 3.0 requirement in the allowed period will be
automatically dismissed and may not be readmitted to the university for at least one
year after the effective date of dismissal.
Students dismissed from the university are not relieved of their financial obligations.
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs regional office will be notified if students
receiving VA educational benefits are suspended or terminated. The Vice President for
Academic Affairs will consider re-entry requests on an individual basis from students
who have been dismissed for unsatisfactory progress.
The Office of Registration and Records will maintain a record of each VA studentâ€™s
grades in accordance with VA regulations. A student can request official transcripts
