The procedures and guidelines adopted by Capitol Technology University (hereinafter
occasionally referred to as the “university”) regarding student records comply fully
with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). This federal law
establishes the rights of students to inspect and review their records, and provides
students with a mechanism for correcting inaccurate or misleading data found within a
student’s education record.
Moreover, FERPA guarantees the privacy of students’ education records. Specifically,
FERPA limits the disclosure of personally identifiable, non-directory, information from
education records, without the consent of the student. Consistent with its obligations,
Capitol Technology University will not release personally identifiable information from
a student’s education records without the student’s consent, except in circumstances
permitted by FERPA (e.g., in connection with a health or safety emergency).
Education records are records, files, documents and other materials containing
information directly related to a student that are maintained by Capitol Technology
