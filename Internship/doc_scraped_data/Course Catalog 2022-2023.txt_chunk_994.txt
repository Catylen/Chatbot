This course covers the definition of “transform,” focusing on the Laplace transform of
algebraic, exponential, and trigonometric functions. It also addressed basic theorems
including shifting, initial, and final-value theorems; unit-step, periodic, and delta
functions; methods of inverting transforms; solutions of differential equations by
transform methods; Fourier series and coefficients; expansion of functions in Fourier
series; complex Fourier coefficients; Parseval’s Theorem; and Fourier transform and its
properties. Prerequisite: MA-340. (3-0-3)
MA-525 - Statistics Using Excel
This course provides an understanding of basic statistical principles and tests and
their application using Excel. Topics include collecting and organizing data, theorems,
descriptive and inferential statistics, probability, discrete and normal distributions,
sampling distributions, central limit theorem, estimation and hypothesis testing and
regression analysis. Prerequisite: undergraduate statistics course or work experience.
