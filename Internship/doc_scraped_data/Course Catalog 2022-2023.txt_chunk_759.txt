The course provides students with an introduction to data sciences, a developing
field that focuses on the knowledge and abilities required to harness the power of
data to advance science and engineering, address difficult domestic and international
problems, inform public policy, and enhance people’s lives. It illustrates how computer
science, statistics, and informatics knowledge and abilities are integrated into the field
of data science (with exposure to application domains such as life science, health
science, cyber security, astronomy, etc.). Students are introduced to the “high-level
view” of data science, including elements for understanding data through exploratory
data analysis, testing hypotheses against data, and building predictive models, all using
real-world examples, through a combination of lectures, manual lectures on workshops,
and case studies. DS 275 will present these concepts in a simpler way with much more
emphasis on data science applications. Understanding of these concepts is tested
through assignments and exams. (3)
