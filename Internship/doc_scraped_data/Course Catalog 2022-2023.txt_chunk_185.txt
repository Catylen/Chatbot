Vocational Rehabilitation
As required by 38 USC 3679(e), students (or ”covered individuals”) receiving educational
assistance under Chapter 31 VR&E, or Chapter 33, Post-9/11 GI bill benefits will not be
assessed late payment fees or have a registration hold placed on their account. Covered
individuals receiving chapter 31 or chapter 33 benefits will not be required to secure
alternative or additional funding to cover the VA benefit amount by the tuition due date
and will not be denied access to any school resources due to delayed VA payments.
If the covered individual’s eligibility does not cover the entire assessed amount of tuition
and fees, the student is responsible for the difference in total tuition and fees and the
covered eligibility amount by the university’s posted tuition and fee payment deadline.
To qualify for this provision, students must provide the university with a Certificate
of Eligibility or VR&E equivalent by the first day of class, along with a request for
certification of benefits and any other required information essential to the VA course
certification process.
