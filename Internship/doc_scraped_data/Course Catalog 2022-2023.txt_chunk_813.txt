EL-212 - Transmission Lines
Study of transmissions lines: characteristic impedance, propagation constant, standing
wave ratio and reflection coefficient. Transmission line response to transients. Bounce
diagrams. Lossless and lossy line analysis using classical approach as well as graphical
approach (Smith Chart). Voltage and power calculations on transmission lines.
Matching techniques for transmission lines and discrete circuits. Measurements using
vector network analyzers. Prerequisite: EL-150. Offered spring semester only. (2-2-3)
EL-220 - Fabrication and Troubleshooting
Covers the basic methods of circuit construction and troubleshooting, including
IC fabrication, wire wrapping, soldering, etching and chassis layout. Identification
and removal of components; project oriented; may be used as a technical elective.
Prerequisite: EL-150 (1-4-3)
EL-240 - Mobile & Cellular Communication Systems
The course is designed to give the student the theory and technologies generally
used in mobile communications. Topics covered include modulation, transmission,
demodulation, antennas and propagation loss, interference, and system performance.
