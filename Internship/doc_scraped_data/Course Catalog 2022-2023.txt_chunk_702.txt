This course is in graduate seminar format. Students integrate prior course work and
personal experiences into researching an approved topic to produce a project-based
paper. Prerequisite: completion of at least 18 credit hours of graduate coursework. (3)
CS-716 - Advanced Artificial Intelligence
This course covers selected deep learning and deep neural network technologies,
drawn from such topics as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks
and generative models. The course will combine coverage of relevant technologies with
consideration of emerging innovations and developments in this field. Prerequisite: CS502 (3)
CS-800 - Computer Science Research Background
The student will focus on the study of the latest Computer Science strategies, tactics
and developments. The student will synthesize the growing effect of Computer Science
on current operations, international relationships and effects on the field, and where
there are areas of improvements or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas
for research at a later stage and explore the background of Computer Science. The
