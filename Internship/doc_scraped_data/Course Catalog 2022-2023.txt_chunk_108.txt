Undergraduate students on academic probation must have a mandatory meeting with
their advisor before registration and may not register for more than 12 semester credits,
or no more than four courses.
Masterâ€™s degree students whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.0 are placed on last
warning. Students on academic probation will be given three semesters (registered for
coursework) to raise their CGPA to 3.0 and must consult with their advisor on the best
course options.
Doctoral students must maintain a 3.0 GPA. A grade of C or below is not acceptable.
A doctoral student who receives a C or lower in any course must repeat that
course, achieving a B or higher before moving on in the program. Students failing to
successfully achieve a grade of B or higher in a single course after three attempts
will be dismissed from the program. A student whose cumulative grade point average
falls below 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Probation will be lifted when the
student achieves a cumulative GPA of 3.0. Students failing to meet any of these criteria
will be dismissed from the doctoral program.
