CS-512 - Computer Language Design
Using parsers and code generation techniques to fashion new mini-languages that can
be used to creatively modify the interface between a user and the computer. Topics
include language design; grammars; regular expression grammars; parsers and parser
construction; parsing expressions; tokenizing; assemblers; engines vs. interpreters;
logic, query and imperative language parsers and assemblers. (3)
CS-513 - Gaming Theory-Real-Time 3D Graphics
The growing importance of virtual realities in training, scientific modeling, and
communication comes on the heels of increasing processor capabilities, new
innovations in hardware, increasingly sophisticated programming languages, and
advanced math-based modeling techniques. Real-time 3D graphics are at the leading
edge of these developments. Topics include mathematical foundations and modeling
techniques, mapping, anti-aliasing, real-time rendering, Binary Space Partition Trees,
object control issues. Uses C++ and the OpenGL graphics interface. (Offered as a full
semester course.) (3)
