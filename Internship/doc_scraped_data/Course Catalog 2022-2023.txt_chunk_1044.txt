Cloud computing services allow users to lease computing resources from large scale
data centers operated by service providers. Using cloud services, users can deploy a
wide variety of applications dynamically and on-demand. Most cloud service providers
use machine virtualization to provide flexible and cost-effective resource sharing.
Organizations must take the proper steps to transition to virtualized services by first
consolidating their server farms, then virtualize infrastructure such as servers and
workstations and databases. This course will use an intensive hands-on approach to
teach students to plan, design and build such a virtualized infrastructure to meet the
needs of the organization in a cost effective, efficient and secure manner. Prerequisite:
