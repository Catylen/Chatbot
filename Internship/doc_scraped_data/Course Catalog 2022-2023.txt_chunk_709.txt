The student will focus on the study of the latest Cybersecurity Leadership strategies,
tactics and developments. The student will synthesize the growing effect of technology
on current operations, international relationships and effects on the field, and where
there are areas of improvements or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas
for research at a later stage and explore the background. The faculty will directly
support and mentor the exploration phase of the planning. (6)
