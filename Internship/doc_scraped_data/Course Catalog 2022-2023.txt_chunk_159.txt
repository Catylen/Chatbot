university determined the student withdrew. Post withdrawal Loan disbursements
require the student or Parent for PLUS loans to authorize the post withdraw
disbursement. Therefore the university will offer the post withdrawal disbursement
within 30 days, giving the student or parent an additional 14 days to accept or decline
the post withdrawal disbursement. If accepted the post withdrawal loan disbursement
will be made within 14 days of student/parent acceptance.
