SE-457 - Senior Design Project I
Students/teams select a project, develop an understanding of the project scope that
includes research and documentation of related work, prepare a feasibility study,
develop project requirements (constraints) and engineering, software, and/or security
specifications, propose solutions and multiple designs, analyze proposed designs,
select a final proposed design, and prepare and present a preliminary design review
(PDR). Students are expected to apply proper systems engineering and project
management to their work. Additional components may be required in some projects.
Students/teams submit a final report at the end of the semester. Pre-requisite: Senior
standing. (3-0-3)
