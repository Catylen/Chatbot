This course gives an introduction to the mathematics of cryptography. A survey of
cryptography from Roman times up to todayâ€™s current techniques. Cryptographic
content for the course includes classical ciphers and their decryption (shift, affine and
Vigenere ciphers), key exchange protocols (main example: Diffie-Hellman), public key
ciphers (main example: RSA), block ciphers, modes of operation, hash functions and
digital signatures. Mathematical formulations of security goals will be discussed as a
method for determining weaknesses in designs. Prerequisites: MA-124 and CS-130 or
CS-150. (3-0-3)
MA-330 - Linear Algebra
This course introduces the study of linear systems of equations, vector spaces, and
linear transformations. Students will solve systems of linear equations as a basic tool
in many mathematical procedures used in science and engineering. Topics include
solving linear equations, performing matrix algebra, calculating determinants, finding
eigenvalues and eigenvectors and developing an understanding of a matrix as a linear
transformation relative to a basis of a vector space. Prerequisite: MA-262. (3-0-3)
MA-340 - Ordinary Differential Equations
