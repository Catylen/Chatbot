modern security threats. The course explores core secure coding principles, strategies,
coding techniques, and tools that aid programmers in developing more resilient and
robust code. Students will develop and analyze C language code that demonstrates
mastery of these secure coding principles. The course will also rely on industry
standards and best practices such as SEI-CERT coding standards and OWASP top 10
web application security risks. Prerequisite: CS-250 (3-0-3)
