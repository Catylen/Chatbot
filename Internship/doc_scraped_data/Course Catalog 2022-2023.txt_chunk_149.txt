Graduate students (masters and doctorate) who are reimbursed by an employer must
submit authorization forms to the Business Office at the time of registration along
with one third (1/3) of the tuition cost. Balance is due ten (10) days after classes end.
Students who do not pay within the ten days will be subject to deferment fees and
required to follow the standard payment options in the future.
Financial Aid
All students who receive financial aid are required to pay the remaining balance in full
or follow the appropriate deferred payment plan. If funds have not been received by
the university from a particular financial aid source, that amount will not be credited to
the studentâ€™s account and cannot be provided to the student, even if notification of the
award has been received.
Book Vouchers
All students receiving financial aid in excess of tuition, fees and on-campus housing
charges may be considered for a book voucher. The Business Office must receive all
financial aid proceeds, including federal and private loans, for students to receive a book
voucher.
Obligation for Payment
Tuition and fees for all students become an obligation in accordance with the provisions
