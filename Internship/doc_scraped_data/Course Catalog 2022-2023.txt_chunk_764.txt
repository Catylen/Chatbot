Introduces multivariate regression and random forests for modeling data. Addresses
data access, variable selection and model diagnostics. Introduces foundations for
visual thinking. Reviews common statistical graphics such as dot plots, box plots, q-q
plots. Addresses more advanced methods such as scatterplot matrices enhanced by
smoothed or density contours, and search tools for finding graphics with suggestive
patterns. Course will introduce R software for analysis. A final project will involve
visualization of a real data set. Prerequisite: Undergraduate statistics. (3)
