Aviation and those with associate knowledge that is needed to be incorporated into
research. The University is in a unique position to give those students an avenue to
pursue a deep proficiency in this area using an interdisciplinary methodology, cuttingedge courses, and dynamic faculty. Graduates will contribute significantly to the
Aviation Maintenance field through the creation of new knowledge and ideas. The
M.Res. in Aviation Maintenance program is designed as a degree by research where
students will quickly become able to engage in leadership, research, and publishing. It
is aimed at those that may want to explore research studies before starting a Doctorate
by research. Likewise, those that work in research and want a master’s qualification but
in a subject specific to their work. Aviation is becoming more technical and managing
this requires higher skills in a larger percentage of the workforce. The university has a
significant experience in aviation and aerospace subjects. Four faculty are Fellows of
the Royal Aeronautical society and many faculty/adjuncts are members.
