The Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering blends theory and practice, directed
at engineering design as opposed to research. The program produces practical design
engineers capable of analyzing the technical needs of society and creates the next
generation of electrical and electronic circuits. Topics covered include circuit theory
and modeling, computer-aided circuit simulation, signals and systems, microwave
engineering, VHDL and telecommunications. All students will complete a capstone in
which they propose, design, build, test, analyze and deliver a working prototype circuit to
meet engineering standards and realistic constraints.
