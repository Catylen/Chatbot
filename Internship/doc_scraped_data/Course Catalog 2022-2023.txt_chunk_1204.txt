processing methods associated with autonomous and semi-autonomous operation
of unmanned systems. The content of the course includes supported capabilities,
reference framework, man-machine collaboration, cognitive capability, interaction
and manipulation, allocation of functions and responsibilities, high-level tradeoffs,
limitations, and associated advancements. This course prepares students to better
understand the implications and capabilities associated with autonomy in unmanned
systems. It will include examinations of associated technology, programming,
processing, and interoperability required to understand the application of autonomy and
automation. Prerequisite: UAS-502. (3)
