Modern organizations operate in a very dynamic and fast-moving environment which
requires collaboration with personnel both internally and externally via state of the art
communications systems and technologies. Operations Center (OC) can be chartered
for daily operations as well as response to specific crisis or situations. This course will
address the design and operation of an OC to include Mission, Network, Intelligence
and Security missions. This course is designed to address how such OCs are chartered,
designed, built, operated, and maintained. This course can be taught in multi-disciplinary
or departmental approach. The course is built upon a virtualized infrastructure which
provides a look at the systems, databases, applications, personnel, and procedures
required to perform the assigned mission. Tours of local OC will be scheduled and
students will conclude the course with a capstone exercise which they will plan and
execute. MOC/NOC/SOC. Prerequisite: IAE-201 (3-0-3) NOTE: Students enrolled in this
