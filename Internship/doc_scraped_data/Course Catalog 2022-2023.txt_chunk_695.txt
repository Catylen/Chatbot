CS-701 - Artificial Intelligence
The artificial intelligence revival of the late 1980s has produced many new and
innovative approaches to the creation of intelligent systems. Such systems permeate
today’s computer environment supporting everything from computer games to
autonomous robotic systems and intelligent agents. The focus of this course will vary
over time. Topics include knowledge representation and rule-based systems, fuzzy-logic
systems, learning systems such as artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms,
genetic programming and evolutionary computing, hybrid intelligent systems, and
intelligent agents. (3)
CS-705 - Multithreaded & Distributed Program
Modern applications such as GUI interfaces use multithreaded programming to
achieve responsiveness and to make efficient use of computer resources. In addition,
the Internet has made distributed programming an integral part of almost every
computing system. In today’s world programmers and computer professionals must
understand the principles underlying both these paradigms. Topics include concepts
and applications of multithreaded and distributed programs. Process interaction using
