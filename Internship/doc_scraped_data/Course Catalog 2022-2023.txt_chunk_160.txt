According to federal regulation, a financial aid student who receives all F’s during
a period of enrollment is considered not to have attended any of his or her classes;
therefore, all financial aid received for that period of enrollment must be returned to
the Department of Education. Financial aid will not have to be returned to the federal
government if at least one of the student’s professors verifies that the student has been
in class and really earns the failing grade. The return of financial aid does not relieve the
student of financial obligations.
