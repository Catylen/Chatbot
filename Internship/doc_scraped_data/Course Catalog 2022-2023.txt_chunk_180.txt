These Maryland State grant program funds (Guaranteed Access Grant and Educational
Assistance Grant) are awarded to full-time eligible students who filed their FAFSA before
the stateâ€™s March 1 deadline.
Guaranteed Access Partnership Program
The Guaranteed Access Partnership Program (GAPP) provides a matching grant award
to eligible Maryland students who receive a Guaranteed Access (GA) grant and who
enroll at Capitol Technology University as a new undergraduate student. Students who
complete the FAFSA by March 1 will automatically be considered for the GA grant by the
Maryland Higher Education Commission. Additional documentation may be required
before the award can be made. Award amounts for the GA grant and matching GAPP
grant are determined by your financial need and cost of attendance. An eligible student
may receive a GAPP grant equal to the GA grant up to the full cost of tuition and fees.
