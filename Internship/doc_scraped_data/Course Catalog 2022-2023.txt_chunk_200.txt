Part-Time Degree-Seeking Students
A part-time degree-seeking student is defined as any student pursuing an undergraduate
degree at Capitol Technology University on a part-time basis. A part-time student may
carry 1-11 credits per semester.
1. File a formal application for admission as far in advance of the proposed
entrance date as possible. An application for admission may be obtained from
the Office of Admissions or online.
2. Enclose a $25 nonrefundable admissions processing fee with the application.
(Applications remain on file for one academic year.) The application fee is waived
for those students submitting electronic applications through the university
website.
3. Forward all official transcripts to the Office of Admissions. Applicants who are
completing, or who have already earned, an associate or bachelorâ€™s degree from
a regionally accredited college need only forward college transcripts. Applicants
who have less than a degree or no college credits must forward an official high
school transcript denoting graduation date or General Equivalency Diploma (GED)
record and college transcripts, if applicable.
