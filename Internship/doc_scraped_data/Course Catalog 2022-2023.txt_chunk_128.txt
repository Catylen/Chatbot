Transfer Credits
Undergraduate Transfer Policies
Unofficial transfer credit evaluations are completed during the admissions process
in consultation with the academic departments. Once the transfer student is enrolled
at Capitol Technology University, an official evaluation is conducted by the assistant
director of registration and records in consultation with the academic departments
and approved by the director of registration and records. The academic evaluator will
consult with faculty who teaches the course at Capitol Technology University if there
is a need or a concern. If there is a need or concern, the student is expected to provide
sufficient documentation that is requested to support the transferred credit approval.
A copy of the official transfer evaluation will be included in the student’s folder. The
approved transfer credits are then added to the student’s permanent academic record
and the student will receive written notification of the official transfer evaluation from
the Office of Registration and Records. Once students matriculate at Capitol Technology
University, they must meet the academic standards for their degree program.
