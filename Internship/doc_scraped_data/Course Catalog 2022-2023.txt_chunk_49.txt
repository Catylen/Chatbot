institution added its second doctoral degree in management and decision sciences.
The increased growth and diversity of programs led the college to become Capitol
Technology University in 2014. Since then, the University has embarked on a longterm strategic plan of continued expansion, including the addition of new facilities on
campus and increased academic programs. In 2017, Dr. Bradford L. Sims became the
eighth president of Capitol Technology University, inheriting the proud legacy that began
with Eugene H. Rietzke.
As a respected regional leader, Capitol Technology University continues to attract the
attention of government agencies and corporate partners. Through a partnership with
NASA, Capitol offers academic programs in astronautical engineering and practical
training at its Space Operations Institute. The National Security Agency and Department
of Homeland Security have designated the University a National Center of Academic
Excellence in Information Assurance Education, and the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers has named the University one of its 12 educational partners.
