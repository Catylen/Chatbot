Readmission
Students who withdraw from the university are eligible for readmission at any time,
unless they have been in violation of the university’s academic regulations, or have been
dismissed for disciplinary reasons. Students who have been admitted to the university
and have not maintained continuous enrollment must resubmit an application for
admission. A readmitted student must meet the degree requirements in place at the
time of readmission in order to qualify for graduation. Applications are available online.
Arrangements for payment of outstanding tuition balances must be made with the
Business Office before readmission is approved.

Continuous Enrollment
To be considered continuously enrolled, a student must not have more than one
academic year (three consecutive semesters) of non-enrollment with the university.
