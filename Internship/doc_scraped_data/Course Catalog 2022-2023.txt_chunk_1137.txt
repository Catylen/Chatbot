Under a Chair and Committee, a student will research the future demands in the Space
Cybersecurity field and how these influence specific research questions. Data collection
and applications will be central to evaluating Space Cybersecurity’s needs in the short,
medium, and long term. The literature review will be more specific in focus and direction
at this stage. (6)
SCS-830 - Strategies for Space Cybersecurity
The student will undertake a robust and comprehensive analysis of the strategies for
the growth and evolution of the Space Cybersecurity field under the direction of their
Chair and Committee. The student will produce a concise direction for research and a
draft methodology. (6)
SCS-840 - Space Cybersecurity Research Proposal
The student will produce a proposal for research that is comprehensive in detail and
planning (i.e., research topic, scope and aims, objectives, and timing plan). The doctoral
student will then complete the research milestones according to the proposal and
research plan. The student’s work will need to pass the IRB and ARB at this stage. (6)
