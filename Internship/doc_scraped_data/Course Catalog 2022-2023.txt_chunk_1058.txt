This course covers calculus-based physics. A continuation of PH-261, topics include
wave motion, vibration and sound, electricity and magnetism, Coulomb’s Law, electrical
fields, and induction. Prerequisite: PH-261. (3-2-4)
PH-263 - Engineering Physics III
This is a calculus-based physics course. It covers an introduction to light, lenses,
and diffraction; photons and their interaction with matter; wave-particle duality, basic
quantum discoveries leading to the Bohr atom and atomic spectra; and the interaction
of electrons and photons with matter with special emphasis on the design of detectors
and electronic devices that use quantum effects. Prerequisite PH-262. (3-2-4)
PH-400 - Einstein’s Theory of Relativity
Introduction to Einstein’s Special and General Theory of Relativity. Topics covered:
the physics of Lorentz contraction, time dilation, the “twin paradox” and energy,
momentum in Special Relativity; mass in Relativity, Schwarzschild metric, Black Holes
and Cosmology, behavior of light and applications to Global Positioning Systems.
Prerequisites: PH-263 and MA-340. (3-0-3)
PH-463 - Quantum Physics
