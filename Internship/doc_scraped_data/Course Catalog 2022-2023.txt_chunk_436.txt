be requested. In this case, students are provisionally admitted and limited to three
courses of enrollment. To achieve full acceptance, provisional students must maintain
a 3.0 cumulative GPA in their first three graduate courses. Upon doing so, students
are automatically converted to full acceptance status. If a provisional student fails to
achieve a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA after completing three courses, then he or
she will be academically dismissed, and will not be permitted to enroll in any further
courses.

Decision-Pending Status
Students with incomplete application packages (missing transcripts, missing essay,
etc.) are classified as decision-pending until the application package is complete.
Decision-pending students who have been approved to register are limited to two
courses of enrollment and are not permitted to enroll in a third class until their
applications are complete.
