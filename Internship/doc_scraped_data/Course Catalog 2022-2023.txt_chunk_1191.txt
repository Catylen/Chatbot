water environment. The capabilities and limitations will be examined and the student
will be able to select the appropriate platform types and sensors to meet application
requirements. Applications explored include both surface and underwater functions
in the civilian, commercial and military fields. Prerequisite: UAS-140. (3-0-3) NOTE:
Students enrolled in this course incur an additional lab fee of $350
UAS-240 - Unmanned Space Vehicles
This course provides the principles and concepts of unmanned and autonomous
vehicles used for space applications. The challenges of space as an environment,
navigation, time, and distance will be included as essential elements of overall space
exploration via unmanned and autonomous systems. Students will explore the problems
of perception, space navigation, communications, control, sensors and payloads, time
delay, and fundamentals of propulsion and motion in space. Capabilities and limitations
of multiple platform types will be examined and the student will be able to select the
appropriate platform types and payloads to meet mission and application requirements.
