Course Drop
There are two course drop periods. The first course drop period occurs during the
registration period and ends on the last day for a 25% refund. The second course drop
period occurs following the period for 25% refund and continues until the date indicated
on the academic calendar.
For a course drop that takes place during the first period, students are entitled to a
percentage refund as outlined in the refund schedule. The course is removed from the
student’s transcript and no grade is assigned.
A course drop that takes place during the second period results in a mark of W on the
student’s transcript. A grade of W does not affect students’ cumulative GPA. Failure to
attend class does not constitute withdrawal from the course and does not eliminate a
student’s academic or financial responsibilities.
If a student drops all classes for the semester (zero credits), he/she is considered
withdrawing from the university and should follow the procedure for withdrawal (as
listed in the following section). Deadline dates for dropping a course with or without a W
from a course are listed in the university catalog and online.
