Application of engineering principles of research into a special project. Projects vary
from semester to semester. Students primarily work in a guided study environment with
a faculty mentor. Prerequisites: permission of instructor and department chair and at
least junior standing. This course may be repeated with different projects. (1-4-3)
EE-403 - Environment/Renewable Energy Systems
Teaches the students theory and practice for direct production of electricity from
alternate energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal. Course material includes
characteristics of direct energy conversion, and storage devices used in alternate
energy sources. Impact of solar heating and lighting on building design is also
introduced. Concepts of engineering economics are discussed as well. This course will
expose students to concepts applied in electrical, civil and mechanical engineering and
architecture. Prerequisite: Senior status. (3-0-3)
EE-404 - Large-scale Digital Design
Analysis and modeling of digital systems, VLSI, VHDL timing, objects and classes.
VHDL-based design processes, concurrent and sequential assignments. Variable
