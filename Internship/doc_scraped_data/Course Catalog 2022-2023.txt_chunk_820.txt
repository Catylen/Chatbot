Noise types and specifications. Natural, man-made and intrinsic noise sources. Thermal,
shot, contact, popcorn and avalanche noise as related to electronic devices. Reactive
network effects on thermal noise. Signal-to-noise ratio, noise figure, noise factor,
noise temperature and noise bandwidth. Low noise design techniques, measurement
techniques for noise factor and noise bandwidth. Ground loops and how to eliminate
them. Grounding techniques, shielding, digital circuit radiation, electrostatic discharge,

EL-400 - Special Projects in Technology
Guided Study. Project-oriented course. Students are expected to design and build
electronic systems in their specialization. Students will produce a final project including
a written report and an oral presentation. (0-6-3)
EL-452 - Automated Test Systems
Systems design course for automating the testing of electronic circuits and systems
in both the engineering and production environments; stresses both hardware design
and system software development. Begins with simple PC-based systems assembly
for circuit testing as part of the design process and progresses to the design and
