Time Limit for Degree Completion
Doctoral students are required to maintain satisfactory progress toward the completion
of course requirements, which must be accomplished within ten years. MS/PhD
students must complete course requirements within ten years. The ten-year period
begins when the oldest course applied to the degree was completed. If a doctoral
student takes more than ten years then approval will be needed from the VPAA to
continue. DSc in Cybersecurity students and PhD in Business Analytics and Data
Science students then have an additional two years after completing all required
coursework to submit and defend their dissertation.

Graduation Clearance
In the final weeks of their last semester of study, students should check with the
Business Office, the Office of Financial Aid, the Office of Residence Life and the Puente
Library to be certain that they have no outstanding obligations. Diplomas and transcripts
will not be issued for students who have outstanding library books or fines, outstanding
balances in the Business Office, or for financial aid recipients who have not completed
the exit interview survey with the Office of Financial Aid.
