retired, it is the VPAA’s responsibility to manage the notification process. In doing so,
the VPAA shall make three separate attempts at contact within 30 calendar days, with
the last one in writing by registered letter to the last known address. If after ten working
days of the VPAA’s receiving the registered letter receipt the instructor still refuses to
discuss the grade appeal, the VPAA shall convene the Grade Appeal Committee.
If an instructor has denied the grade appeal after having met with the department
chairperson, the VPAA must review the materials and discuss the matter with
the student. The VPAA may choose to discuss the matter with the instructor, the
chairperson, or both. If the VPAA cannot create a resolution satisfactory to the
instructor and student, the VPAA shall convene the Grade Appeal Committee.
