CM-600 - Cybersecurity Impacts on Construction Industry

The student will focus on the study of the latest Construction Science processes
and developments. The student will synthesize the growing effect of technology on
current operations, international relationships and effects on the field, and where there
are areas of improvements or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas for
research at a later stage and explore the background. (6)
CM-810 - Construction Science Research Methodologies
The student will evaluate and develop research methodologies and strategies suitable
for Construction Science and address the data sources and information to test a
hypothesis or research question. It is expected the student will be building upon CM-800
in refining and developing their research task and plan. (6)
CM-820 - Construction Science Future Demands
The student will research the future demands Construction Science and how these
influence specific research questions. Data collection and applications will be central to
evaluating the needs of Construction Science on the short, medium and long term. (6)
