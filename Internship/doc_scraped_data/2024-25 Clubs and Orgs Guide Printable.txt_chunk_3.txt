The university may hold student leaders and members of an organization accountable for the conduct
of the organization’s guests.
Every student is encouraged to enhance Capitol Technology University’s campus and their
own college experience by getting involved. Being a part of a student club or organization
allows you to experience CapTechU in another light besides the classroom. First, student
clubs & organizations add an important component to campus life at CapTechU by allowing
the student voice to be heard and seen on campus. Secondly, students gain valuable
experience in the practical aspects of leadership, communication, risk management, respect,
accountability, responsibility, and teamwork. Statistics have shown that students who are
involved in student clubs & organizations maintain a higher GPA and are self-aware with being
active on campus.
