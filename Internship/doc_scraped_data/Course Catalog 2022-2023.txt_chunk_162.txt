Application Procedures
One of the most important aspects of the financial aid process is to apply for assistance
as early as possible. The application due dates are priority deadlines. Students who
meet the priority deadlines enjoy the security of having their award authorization ready
in time for class registration.
1. You must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) to apply for federal and state financial aid. Complete the application as
early as October 1, 2021, or by priority date of March 1, 2022, or as far in advance
of the starting term as possible. Apply online with FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov.
Be sure to list Capitol Technology University on the FAFSA, School Code 001436,
so the FAFSA information will be electronically forwarded to the university.
A paper FAFSA can be obtained by requesting one from the Department of
Education at 1-800-433-3243.
2. After reviewing your processed FAFSA data, the Office of Financial Aid will send
an award letter listing the awards for which you are eligible.
3. Sign and return one copy of the award letter to the Office of Financial Aid.
