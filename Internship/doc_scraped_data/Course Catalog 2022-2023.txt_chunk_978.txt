This course provides an introduction to the study of intelligence and international
security by training students in intelligence analysis to enable them to write
briefing and analytic products that are used in the analysis of international security,
counterterrorism, and homeland security studies. Such an integrated analytic approach
is required because of the integrated nature of international security, counterterrorism,
and homeland security. The analytic methodologies taught will draw on the concepts
of risk-based security management approaches. Students will also explore the national
strategies and programs developed by the United States and its allies to deal with ongoing threats at the international, national, and local levels, including how to balance
the need for security and maintenance of civil liberties. Students will apply the courseâ€™s
analytic intelligence methodologies to examine selected case studies. (3)
