PH-201 - General Physics I
This is a non-calculus-based physics course intended for credit in engineering
technology courses. PH-261 is to be used for electrical, computer, and software
engineering courses. PH-201 addresses mechanics, focusing on units, conversion
factors, vector diagrams, translational equilibrium, friction, torque and rotational
equilibrium, uniformly accelerated motion, projectiles, Newtonâ€™s Law, work energy
and power, kinetic and potential energy, conservation of energy, and impulse and
momentum. It also addresses heat, focusing on temperature scales, thermal properties
of matter, heat and temperature change, heat and change of phase, physics of heat
transfer, and applications. Prerequisite: MA-114. Students completing this course may
not enroll in PH-261 for additional credit. (2-2-3)
PH-202 - General Physics II
Non-calculus-based physics intended for credit in engineering technology courses. Use
PH-262 for electrical, computer and software engineering courses. Light and sound:
wave motion, nature of light, reflection and mirrors, refraction, prisms, dispersion lenses;
simple harmonic motion; sound transmission, resonance, interference. Doppler Effect.
