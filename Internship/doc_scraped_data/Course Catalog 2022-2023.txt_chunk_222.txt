CAPITOL TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY

Undergraduate Studies

The Bachelor of Science in Astronautical Engineering provides students with a balance
between theory and practice. Students receive hands-on design experience via the
university’s high-altitude balloon payload program, course assignments, laboratory
exercises and the Space Flight Operations Training Center. The focus is on spacecraft
and ground systems design rather than research. The program produces skilled
systems-oriented astronautical engineers to support the needs of NASA and the
aerospace industry.
