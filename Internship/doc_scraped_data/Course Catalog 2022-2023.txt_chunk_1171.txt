Project IV covers the basic concepts of probability, common distributions, statistical
methods, data analysis, developing a critical approach to the analysis of contingency
tables, examining the basic ideas and methods of generalized linear models, linking
logit and log-linear methods with generalized linear models, and developing basic
facility in the analysis of discrete data using SAS, R, and Python. The project will also
cover operations research techniques and their application to decision making such
as mathematical optimization, networks modeling, stochastic modeling, and multiobjective modeling. Other topics covered include computer simulation, decision analysis
using decision trees, and quantitative value functions. The project will culminate with
visualization techniques. Students will learn different means of combating information
overload as well as visual encoding as a method to supplant cognitive calculations with
simpler perceptual inferences, improve comprehension, memory, and decision making.
