The official results of all CLEP exams must be submitted to the Office of Registration
and Records no later than two semesters before completion.
Validation Exams
Undergraduate students who can demonstrate competence in a subject without having
completed the specific coursework, due to relevant work or life experience, may take
a specially arranged validation examination. Not every course, however, lends itself to
the validation process, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the studentâ€™s
department chair must grant permission for the examination to be given. Validation
examinations are thorough and cannot be taken a second time. In addition, a student
may not request a validation exam for a course in which a grade of D or lower has been
earned.
Students interested in taking a validation exam should visit the Office of Registration
and Records, where forms and procedures (including fees) are available. Students
who pass the validation examination receive a V on their transcript and the appropriate
number of semester credits. No partial credit or quality points are awarded.
