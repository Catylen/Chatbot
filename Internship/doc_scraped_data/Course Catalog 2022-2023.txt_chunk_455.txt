The Master of Science in Computer Science is structured to focus on new technologies,
graphics aimed at virtual realities, and the Internet. The program provides students
with the advanced knowledge and skills necessary to design and use computerbased systems, with an emphasis on emerging technologies, including embedded
languages, wireless technologies, miniaturization (PDAs), and data security. Students
study computer language design, intelligent systems design, and multi-threaded and
distributed programming and may specialize in an area of their choice, including
information architecture, network security or advanced computer science. All students
complete a capstone in which they identify a research topic and develop a major projectbased research paper.
