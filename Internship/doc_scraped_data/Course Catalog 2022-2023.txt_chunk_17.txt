Emergency Closing
In the event of severe weather or other emergencies, cancellations or late openings
will be announced to area radio and television broadcasts and posted on the university
website.
The university maintains a recorded message at 301-369-2800 and 888-522-7486,
and posts a weather advisory on the website when possible. Due to power outages
and other circumstances that occur during adverse weather, it is not always possible
to update this information. It is the responsibility of students to tune in to the radio or
television for announcements.
