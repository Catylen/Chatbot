• Student Life recognizes the benefits of co-curricular involvement by providing services and
resources that engage students in creating campus culture through social, cultural, intellectual,
spiritual, athletic, recreational, artistic, political, and service opportunities. It is important that
students ensure that academic classes are the first priority before organizing events or
meetings. Student Clubs & Organizations must make every effort to create a schedule that fits
the members’ academic schedules for mandatory events. If for any reason this is not possible,
the organization should schedule make-up time for that member(s).
