MA-325 - Mathematics of Cryptography

mechanics and rate problems. It also covers solutions of second order equations by
undetermined coefficients and variations of parameters. Applications to circuits are
also included as well as an introduction to systems of equations and operational and
numerical methods. Prerequisite: MA-262. (3-0-3)
MA-345 - Probability & Statistics Engineers
This course focuses on sets and methods of counting, as well as probability density
functions, expected values, and correlations. Forms of distribution addressed included
binomial, Poisson, exponential, and normal. Additional topics covered include the
central limit theorem, statistical estimation, an introduction to stochastic processes,
and applications to noise and reliability. Prerequisite: MA-262. (3-0-3)
MA-355 - Numerical Analysis
This course covers number systems, floating-point arithmetic, and error analysis, as
well as Taylor, interpolating and mini-max polynomials. Integration and differentiation,
methods of solving equations, and systems of linear equations are also addressed.
