This course provides the principles and concepts essential to the design and operation
of unmanned and autonomous systems (UAS) and their subsystems. Communications,
components, and networking are explored as the infrastructure to ensure system and
subsystem interoperability. Students will examine technologies dealing with facets of
mobile computing platforms, machine-learning, network protocols and communication
systems to support intra-system and inter-system coordination. Topics include system
requirements, constraints, dependability, regulations, communications, cybersecurity,
avionics and sensors. Prerequisite: UAS-140. (3-0-3) NOTE: Students enrolled in this
course incur an additional lab fee of $350
UAS-220 - Intro to Processing Remote Sensed Data
Students are introduced to basic theory, history, and practical applications of remote
sensing technology, with an emphasis on high spatial resolution multispectral aerial
imagery collected using unmanned aircraft systems. Other topics include geographic
information systems, aerial image interpretation, sensor resolution, orthomosaicing,
georegistration, vegetation indices, and image classification. Prerequisite: UAS-201. (30-3)
