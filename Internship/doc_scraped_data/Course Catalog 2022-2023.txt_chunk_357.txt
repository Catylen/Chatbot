The Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science provides students with the opportunity
to conduct extensive and sustained original research at the highest level in the field of
operational technology. Computer Science (CS) is a multifaceted discipline. CS is the
hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring
and control of industrial equipment, assets, processes, and events. CS is also the
technology that interfaces with the physical world, including Industrial Control Systems
(ICS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Distributed Control Systems
(DCS), and the Internet of Things (IoT). The PhD in Computer Science is a unique
doctoral program designed to meet the demands of the highest skilled professionals to
become the leaders who will be involved in the advancement, expansion, and support
of the Computer Science industry. Computer Science has existed since the discovered
ability to use and store business data with machines and electricity has powered
machinery and equipment in factories, buildings, transportation, systems, the utility
industry, and more. However, the accelerating convergence of CS with Information
