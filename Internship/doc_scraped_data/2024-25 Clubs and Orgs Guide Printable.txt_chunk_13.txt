Mediation and Reporting of Concerning Behavior Among Clubs & Organization
As a resource to student clubs & organizations, Student Life will provide staff for the
mediation of intra/inter-organizational conflict. The goal of any meeting will be to find an
alternative solution to identify the problem(s). The mediation will be considered confidential
unless information provided violates university policy. If for any reason the information does
violate the universityâ€™s policy the Director of Student Life & Residential Services, the Dean of
Students and/or designee will be notified for involvement.
It is the duty of each officer and their advisor(s) within their perspective club and
organization to report any concerning activity or incident to the university by ways of Student
Life.
To request mediation on any problem(s) within your perspective club or organization
please contact the S-LAB president at slab@captechu.edu to discuss the problem(s). If S-LAB
decides that administration will need to be involved the president will provide an email requesting
a meeting with Student Life for further mediation.
