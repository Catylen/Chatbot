Doctoral students may request a Leave of Absence (LOA) by completing the Leave of
Absence Request form on the Registration and Records page of the MyCapitol portal.
When requesting an LOA, keep in mind, all coursework must be completed within a ten
year time period. This does not include the additional two years allowed for dissertation
completion and defense for DSc in Cybersecurity and PhD in Business Analytics and
Data Science students.
All LOA requests must be submitted in writing, including the reason for the request,
and be signed and dated. In order to adhere to federal regulations of the Department of
Education, the LOA, together with any additional leaves of absence, must not exceed a
total of 180 days in any 12-month period. The 12-month period begins on the initial date
of the LOA. At leave expiration, students must re-enroll or (if qualified) request an LOA
extension. If the student has not returned at the end of the 180-day period, the school is
required to notify the Department of Education of the student’s last date of attendance.
This will affect the student’s federal financial aid and loan repayment status. Students
