Under a Chair and committee, a student will continue evaluating and develop research
methodologies and strategies suitable for understanding Engineering Management and
address the data sources, information, and intelligence to test a hypothesis or research
question. It is expected the student will be building upon EGM-800 in refining and
developing their research task and plan. Prerequisite: EGM-800. (6)
EGM-820 - Engineering Management Future Demands
Under a Chair and committee, a student will further research the future demands in the
Engineering Management field and how these influence specific research questions.
Data collection and applications will be central to evaluating the needs of Engineering
Management on the short, medium and long term. The literature review will be more
specific in focus and direction at this stage. Prerequisite: EGM-810. (6)
EGM-830 - Strategies for Engineering Management
The student will undertake a robust and comprehensive analysis of the strategies for
the growth and evolution of the Engineering Management field under the direction
of their Chair/committee. A firm direction and draft of a methodology will be taking
