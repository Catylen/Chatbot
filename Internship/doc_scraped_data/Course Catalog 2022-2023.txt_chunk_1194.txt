This course presents the challenges to unmanned and autonomous systems (UAS)
encountered in their operational capacities. The student is exposed to the aspects
of extreme environments where the vehicles and communications must operate in
all conditions. The presence of adverse factors and disturbances could disrupt the
function of the communications and controllers and lead to significant degradation
of performance, causing instability and possible damages. Students learn to match
platform capabilities, communications abilities, and payloads with the mission
requirements to meet the demands of a variety of environments. The students develop
an understanding of extreme or uncertain environments, the limitations inflicted on UAS
systems, and possible methods to overcome them. Prerequisite: UAS-140. (3-0-3)
