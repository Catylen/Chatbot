UAS-502 - Unmanned & Autonomous Vehicle Systems
This course provides an overview of theory and practice of unmanned and autonomous
vehicle systems, including hardware, software, command, control, and communication
(C3) structures of mobile robotic systems development. Topics include an overview
of platforms (including land, air, marine, and space platforms), actuators and motion
control, sensors and perception (including GPS, inertial, magnetic, active ranging,
computer vision, photo detectors, and encoders), planning and navigation (including
reactive, deliberative, and hybrid approaches to autonomy). Case studies, readings from
current literature, and guest lectures present best practices in the field. The course
includes a microprocessor-based project. Prerequisite: None. (3)
UAS-510 - Unmanned Systems Autonomy & Automation
This course provides students with an opportunity to examine the benefits, limitations,
and capabilities of autonomous control technology and support for unmanned systems.
The student will examine and evaluate elements, components, technology, and
processing methods associated with autonomous and semi-autonomous operation
