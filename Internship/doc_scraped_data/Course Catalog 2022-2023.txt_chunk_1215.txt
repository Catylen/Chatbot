The Capstone Project is the culminating effort of the student’s entire learning
experience. The student will complete a comprehensive exam that provides significant
evidence of experience in unmanned and autonomous systems studies, master’s
level thesis and research project (with submission of a final report, approval by a
thesis committee, and an oral defense of the research work), or a project resulting in
fabrication of a prototype and publication of refereed article. Students will work with
designated faculty to formulate, develop, and complete the project, thesis, or exam. The
completion of the Capstone Course is designed to document significant evidence that
all Program Outcomes have been met and provide the student evidence of experience to
show to current and prospective employers. This Capstone Course must be taken at the
end of the student’s degree program. Should be taken in next to last term. (3)
