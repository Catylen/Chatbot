Verification of Appropriateness of Appeal

When a recommendation is made by the Grade Appeal Committee, the Grade Appeal
Committee shall prepare a written summary of the recommendation and transmit the
recommendation to the VPAA. Within 10 calendar days, the VPAA will transmit the
recommendation to the student, instructor, and chairperson.
If a grade change is recommended, the VPAA shall prepare a letter to the Registrar
stating the new grade. The letter will carry the signature of the VPAA and the members
of the committee. No such letter is required if there is no change in grade.

Grade Changes
Occasionally, a grade must be changed as errors do occur. However, grade changes will
not be accepted later than six months after a term has ended; therefore, if a student
truly feels that a mistake has been made, he or she must investigate as soon as
possible after the grade is issued (see Grade Appeal above).
