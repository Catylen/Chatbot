Tuition and fees for all students become an obligation in accordance with the provisions
of the refund schedule in this section. Failure to pay any debt when due to the university
is considered sufficient cause to bar the student from classes or examinations or
to withhold diploma, scholastic certificate or transcript of record. Students with
outstanding accounts will be sent to collections. Collection or litigation expenses
associated with this account are the responsibility of the student. Students whose
accounts are past due one semester will be notified that their accounts are in jeopardy
of being referred to a collection agency.
