This course provides the student with an understanding of the complexities of sensory
operations and data processing in unmanned and autonomous systems (UAS). The
student will examine multiple sensory devices including their capabilities, acquisition
rates, and constraints as factors of device selection. The issues of data acquisition,
formats, storage, processing, and communications within the vehicle, the system, and
between multiple systems will be explored. Prerequisite: UAS-502. (3)
UAS-530 - User Interface for Design & Evaluation
This course introduces user interfaces for unmanned and autonomous systems through
designing, implementing, and evaluating human-computer interfaces of various types.
It focuses on the emerging field of human-robot interaction (HRI) which comprises
a multitude of disciplines including: robotics, artificial intelligence, human factors,
human computer interaction and cognitive psychology. Topics include: Approaches to
human-system interactions for unmanned systems including graphical user interfaces,
non-visual feedback (haptic, aural, etc.), gesture-based controls, voice-based controls,
