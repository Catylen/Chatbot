Cryptography is indispensable for providing confidentiality of information in computer
systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and
how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of
cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications.
Students will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing
systems. The course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties
generate a shared secret key. Students will cover the relevant number theory and
discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange. Prerequisite: IAE-301, MA-114

IAE-390 - Penetration Testing
This course explores the foundational concepts, methods and techniques in preparing
and conducting penetration tests. Throughout the course students are introduced to
various tools as well as unravel complex methods for exploiting client-side, service side
and privilege escalation attacks. Most importantly students learn how to construct a
final report outlining discovered vulnerabilities, make suggested recommendations to
