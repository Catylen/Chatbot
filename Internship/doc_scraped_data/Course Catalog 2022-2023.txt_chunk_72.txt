Academic Policies and Procedures
Program Advisors
Degree-seeking students are assigned academic advisors before registration. Students
are encouraged to work closely with advisors in developing their programs of study.
Academic advisors are available for guidance, but each student must assume final
responsibility for conforming to university regulations and curriculum requirements.
