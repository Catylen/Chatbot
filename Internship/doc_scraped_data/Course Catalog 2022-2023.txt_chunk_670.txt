objects and interfaces; as well as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and
aggregation; Students will explore the Unified Process and Object Oriented software
life cycle. CASE tools and iterative and incremental software development approaches
are also covered. Advantages of Object Oriented design patterns are demonstrated.

CS-406 - Requirements and Resource Analysis
Requirements analysis is crucial to avoid failure of a system or project. The
requirements should be well documented, measurable, verifiable, plausible to fulfill, easy
to keep track of and precise. Students will learn to identify stakeholders and elucidate
needed information from them to formulate software requirement specification
agreements, as well as examine the resources and skill sets needed to support
the requirements. Among the strategies studied will be: goal modeling, software
prototyping, and case development. Prerequisite: CS-225 or CS-230 or CS-200
CS-407 - Database Systems Implementation
This is an undergraduate version of the graduate database course CS-507. Emphasis
