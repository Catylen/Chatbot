Online Learning
Capitol Technology University makes it possible for busy professionals to earn master’s
degrees, doctorates, or technology-related certificates on their own schedule. The
university offers many of its degree programs in a flexible, asynchronous format. Capitol
professors, drawn from the ranks of skilled professionals in their fields, are accessible
and ready to assist students and prospective students with any questions they may have.
Other programs offer the option of a live, virtual classroom format in which students
can interact with their instructor and fellow students in real time. All live classes are
recorded and available for later replay.
All of Capitol’s master’s degree programs are offered entirely online. Our pioneering
doctoral programs in cybersecurity (DSc) and business analytics and data science (PhD)
are primarily online, with an annual residency during which you will work with Capitol
faculty members to shape your research ideas into a finished project. All of our other
doctorate programs are offered in a no-residency, researched-focused modality.
