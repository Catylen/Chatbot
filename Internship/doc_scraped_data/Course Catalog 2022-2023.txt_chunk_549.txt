AVT-457 - Aviation Senior Project I
Students/teams select a project area, develop an understanding of the project scope
that includes research and documentation of related work, prepare a feasibility
study, develop project requirements, propose solutions and multiple designs, analyze
proposed designs, select a final proposed design, and prepare and present a preliminary
design review (PDR). Students are expected to apply proper aviation concepts and
project management to their work. Additional components may be required in some
