Contents of Formal Appeal
The student should attach to the appeal forms as much of the relevant physical and
electronic record as is possible to collect. If the basis of differential standards is
asserted, the student should provide a list of the names of other students and specific
assignments so that a review of the relevant materials and appropriate comparisons
can be made.
