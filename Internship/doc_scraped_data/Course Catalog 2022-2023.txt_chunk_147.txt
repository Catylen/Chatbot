Deferred Payment Plan
The deferred payment plan allows semester students to pay their tuition in three
installments: one-third at registration, one-third on or before the end of the fourth
week of classes and one-third on or before the end of the eighth week. Students taking
8-week classes may also pay their tuition using a deferred payment plan; 50 percent
of tuition is due upon registration and the remaining balance is due four weeks after
classes begin. The cost of the deferred payment plan is $30, which is due with the first
installment.
Nonpayment of tuition deposits may result in registration cancellation. Failure to adhere
to the arrangements of the deferred payment plan may result in immediate dismissal
from the university. Students who abuse the deferred payment plan will not be allowed
to defer their tuition in the future.
Students on academic last warning are not eligible to use the deferred payment plan
and must pay their tuition in full at registration.
