of a COTS system, and student presentations and papers. The initial lectures will
cover both the basics of per-component computational modeling as well as end-toend concerns mission and information assurance requirements for real-world fullscale systems. There will be additional focus on a risk-based approach to securing
such communications systems based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of data. Students will then work with the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) (and other network
simulation tools) to model a single discrete space asset or a multi-component ground
communications system, including preparation for the STK Certification Exam. The
student will then model their own scenario using mission modeling software. Finally,
each student will present their specific scenario to the class, including critical analysis
