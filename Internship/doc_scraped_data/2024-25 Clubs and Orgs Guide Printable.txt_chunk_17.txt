If an event is hosted at an off-campus facility, SLAB will need to be notified at least one (1)
month in advance with the completed paperwork and advisement of the steps for off campus
traveling. This time frame will allow SLAB and Student Life to plan accordingly.

Funding
Starting Budget
Each student club or organization must have an active treasurer to manage their funds. Each
registered student club or organization is encouraged to keep track of their own funds being used. On
the last day of each month SLAB will provide a financial report to each club or organization regarding
their spending. Student Activity Fees (SAF) will be allotted based on membership within the club and
organization. (approximately $250/semester, $500/yearly)
New Clubs & Organizations do not receive any funding for their first year in operation,
however if needed the club or organization may request funds from S-LAB.
