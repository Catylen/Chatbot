Audited Courses
Students who register to audit a course are charged the same tuition as those who
register for credit. The grade of X is awarded at the end of the semester/term and is not
used in computing the cumulative grade point average. Half-time, financial aid students
that change to audit will have part or all of their aid returned to the federal government.
Students receiving VA benefits will not receive payment for audited courses. Any
student receiving financial aid contemplating an audit should contact the Office of
Financial Aid. Once registered for audit, students are not permitted to change to credit
after the first two weeks of the semester. The last day to change from credit to audit is
listed in the university catalog and online.
