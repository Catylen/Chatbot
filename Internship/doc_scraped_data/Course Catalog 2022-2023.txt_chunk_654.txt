This course provides a deeper look into the Java language with a special emphasis on
object oriented design. Topics include multidimensional arrays, inheritance, interfaces,
polymorphism, graphical user interfaces, exception handling, I/O, multithreading and
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). Programming projects are assigned as homework.
Prerequisite: CS-130 Corequisite: CS-220. Offered spring semester only. (3-0-3)
CS-230 - Data Structures
Advance pointers and dynamic memory usage. Concepts of object-oriented design
and programming. Includes classes, friend functions, templates, operator overloading,
polymorphism, inheritance, exception handling, containers, iterators and the standard
template library. Applications involve the use of simple data structures such as stacks,
queues, linked lists and binary trees. Recursion, searching and sorting algorithms. The
above concepts are implemented through a series of hands-on programming projects,
all of which are completed as part of the homework requirements. Prerequisite: CS-225
or CS-200. Corequisite: MA-124. (3-0-3)
CS-240 - Introduction to Data Mining
