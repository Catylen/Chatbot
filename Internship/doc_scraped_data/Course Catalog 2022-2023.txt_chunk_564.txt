AVT-703 - Aviation Cybersecurity Research Project
Students will conduct a graduate level research project in the field of aviation
cybersecurity. The research and thesis development are supervised by a faculty
member. The student will research and write the thesis in this course and prepare to
defend the thesis in a viva voce (i.e., oral) examination. This course is the last course in
the program as the student applies accumulated knowledge of programâ€™s classes to this
effort. Prerequisite: Should be taken in last semester. (3)
AVT-800 - Aeronautical Sci Research Background
The student will focus on the study of Aviation process and developments over
the previous decades and how the influences of war, demand and technology has
supported the systems and procedures we currently use. In particular, how the current
operations and global dictates have resulted in where the industry operates and where
there are areas of improvements or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas
for research at a later stage and explore the background. (6)
AVT-810 - Aeronautical Sci Research Methodologies
The student will evaluate and develop research methodologies and strategies suitable
