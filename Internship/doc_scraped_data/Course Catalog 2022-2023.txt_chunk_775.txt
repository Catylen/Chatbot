EE-309 - Circuit Design and Simulation
An advanced circuit analysis course that introduces students to computer-aided
electronics packages and automated design. Students design and analyze circuits both
mathematically and with computer simulation. Students build the circuits and compare
predicted results with measured results obtained in the laboratory. Prerequisites: MA261 and EL-250 or equivalent. (2-2-3)
EE-340 - Systems Engineering
An interdisciplinary course with both technical and management aspects of large,
multifaceted engineering projects. Special emphasis placed on design, implementation,
and improvement of mechatronic systems. Topics include systems engineering,
engineering management, economics, quality control and engineering, project
management, production systems planning and operations, and human factors.
Prerequisite: BUS-301. (3-0-3)
EE-353 - Power Systems Engineering
Fundamentals of power transmission and electric motors. Single versus three-phase,
poly-phase systems, synchronous, asynchronous machines. DC and compound DC
motors, induction motors. Equivalent circuit modeling of motors. Start-up conditions.
