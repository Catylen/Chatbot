This course covers various business and technical aspects of intelligent automation,
including its motivations, benefits, detriments, tools, and techniques. The mixture
of robotic process automation (RPA), machine learning engineering, and low-code
techniques shows students how to maximize automation while minimizing complexity.
Students will demonstrate the ability to evaluate and apply intelligent automation
techniques to one or more given problems. Prerequisites: CS-502 (3)
CS-610 - Machine Learning & Neural Networks
Basics of neural network computing, important neural network models such as
Adaline, Perceptron, back propagation, self-organizing maps, Hopfield nets. Analysis
and limitations of neural networks; programming neural networks using OOP. CS-511
recommended. (3)
CS-620 - Operating Principles for Information Assurance
This course is an overview of the UNIX operating system. The content will include shell
programming, process management, processor management, storage management,
scheduling algorithms, resource protection and system programming. The course will
include programming projects focused on Information Assurance problem solving
