The student will produce a proposal for research that is comprehensive in detail and
planning. The proposal will address the research topic, scope and aims, objectives
and include a timing plan. The doctoral student will then complete the research
milestones according to the proposal and research plan. The IRB and ARB will need to
be completed by this stage.
SUS-900 - Sustainability Doctoral Writing I
The student will compose and complete Chapters 1 and 2 within the boundaries of the
proposal and research plan. Chapters 1-2 will be reviewed by the studentâ€™s Chair and
Committee and must be approved for the student to advance. The material for these
chapters will have been established in the SUS 800 series. Any disagreement within the
committee will be reviewed by the Dean of Doctoral Programs.
SUS-910 - Sustainability Doctoral Writing II
The student will compose and complete Chapter 3 (methodology chapter that is robust
and identifies all implications) according to the approved proposal. After receiving the
necessary approvals, the student will conduct data collection and analysis activities
consistent with the research plan.
