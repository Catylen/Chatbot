Change of Degree Program
Students who want to change degree programs must fill out a change of degree
program form, which may be obtained in the Office of Registration and Records or
online. The studentâ€™s new department chair must approve all changes of degree
programs. Students who change their degree program are required to meet all
requirements of the new programs that are in effect at the time of the change. Transfer
credits and courses that have already been completed will be applied toward the new
degree program, where appropriate. Any student receiving financial aid considering a
change of degree should see the Office of Financial Aid. Completed documentation
must be submitted to the Office of Registration and Records after academic department
chair approval.
