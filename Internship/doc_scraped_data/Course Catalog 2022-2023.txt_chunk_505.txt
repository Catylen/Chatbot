This course covers the basic theory and practical knowledge to use, operate, manage, or
conduct tests in vacuum chambers. Terminology, equipment, and methods of obtaining
and maintaining vacuum environments, especially regarding space simulation testing
are covered. Topics will include types of vacuum pumps, system components, vacuum
gauges, fittings, flanges, materials, and their integration. Basic test procedures and
standards. (3-0-3)
AE-205 - CubeSat Engineering
End-to-end rapid development of a CubeSat-type satellite sensor system, power bus,
and Arduino-based CPU. Students will form multi-disciplinary teams to collectively
build, integrate and test a working design. Emphasis on design formalism, key trades,
resource calculations, and integration of systems. Recipes and hardware components
will be provided. Prerequisites: AE-150 or CS-130 or EL-100. (3-2-2)
AE-250 - Ground Systems Engineering
Introduces the components that make up a satellite ground system. Included is the
design and analysis of ground system components. Provides an introduction into
satellite telemetry, command, and control subsystems, as well as the software needed
