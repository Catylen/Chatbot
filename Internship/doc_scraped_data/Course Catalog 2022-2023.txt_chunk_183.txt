Other Aid Programs
Private Organizations
In addition to federal, state and institutional financial aid programs, private
organizations offer financial aid funds for a college education.
Many local clubs, religious organizations and other groups provide scholarships for
deserving students. Students should visit their public library to research these possible
sources or contact organizations such as the American Legion, 4-H clubs, Kiwanis,
Jaycees, Chamber of Commerce, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. Organizations connected
with family, friends, and fields of interest, such as the American Society of Professional
Engineers or the Society of Women Engineers, are also options.
A scholarship packet has been developed by the Office of Financial Aid to assist
students. It is available for download at the universityâ€™s website under Financial Aid
Office and on MyFA.
