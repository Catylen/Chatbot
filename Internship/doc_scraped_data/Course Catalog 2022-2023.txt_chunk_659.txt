CS-310 - Computer Algorithms
This course covers mathematical fundamentals of algorithms and algorithmic
techniques. Running time analysis of an algorithm, searching, sorting, and other
techniques associated with retrieving information are covered. Advanced Data
structures such as Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and graph algorithms are used. Dynamic
programming (Knapsack, Floyd, DNA Algorithms), and greedy algorithms (Coins,
Scheduling, Huffman encoding, etc.) are used. Course requires written programming
