Provides an in-depth introduction to the components that compose satellite ground
systems in the commercial, military, and civil sectors from the inception of the space
program to present day. Discusses conceptual and planned software development,
integration, and testing, launch operations, sustainment engineering, decommissioning
of ground systems components and the system engineering processes involved
in these activities. Introduces students to the tools and methods needed to create
dynamic ground system components based on automation and autonomic principles.
Cover CCSDS, ISO-900X, CMMI, UML, mission planning, flight dynamics principles and
risk mitigation/anomaly resolution practices. Introduces STOL, CECIL, XML, and XTCE
languages. Prerequisites: AE-150, CS-150 and EN-102. Corequisite: AE-311. Offered
during Fall semester only. (3-0-3)
AE-351 - Orbital Mechanics
Newton’s equations and Kepler’s laws. Use of spherical coordinates to solve for orbital
equations. Corrections to basic equations caused by earth’s geometry, the moon, and
the sun. Other effects depending on orbital parameters. Corequisite: MA-340. Offered
during Fall semester only. (3-0-3)
