Full-Time Student Tuition Cap
Capitol Technology University offers a tuition-cap program for undergraduate students
registered full time. Academic year tuition increases are capped at a maximum of 1%
per year from the students’ first full-time semester for up to five years. To remain eligible
for the tuition-cap rate, students must adhere to the following terms and conditions.
Maintain continuous full-time enrollment during the academic year (minimum
12 credits per semester).
• Keep all financial accounts up to date. (Consult the academic calendar for
due dates.)
• Remain in good academic standing. (See page 34 for academic
performance.)
If these terms are not met, the student will no longer be eligible for the tuition cap and
will be subject to the prevailing tuition rate.
