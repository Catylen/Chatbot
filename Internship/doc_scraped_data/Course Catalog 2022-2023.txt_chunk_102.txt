Grade Appeal Committee
The Grade Appeal Committee will consist of five members with one alternate from the
Faculty Advisory Council appointed by the VPAA. Members of a department may serve
on the grade appeal of a departmental colleague. When the instructor in question is a
member of the committee, she/ he is recused and the alternate shall serve in her/his
place.
Without regard to the calendar, once a formal appeal has been submitted to the
committee, that committee shall remain with the appeal until its conclusion. If two
or more grade appeals are received by the VPAA about the same instructor and
same course, the committee can determine to combine them into one process if the
committee determines the studentsâ€™ rights to appeal are not compromised.
The Grade Appeal Committee will review all materials from the previous steps of
the grade appeal process. If necessary, the Grade Appeal Committee may request
additional materials from the student and/or the instructor that are pertinent to the
specific case.
