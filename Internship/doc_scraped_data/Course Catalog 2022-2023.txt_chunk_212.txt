A non-degree-seeking student is any student pursuing a non-degree certification
program or taking individual courses not applying to a degree. Non-degree study is not
eligible for financial aid.
Application Requirements
Non-degree seeking students must submit an official transcript showing appropriate
degree (i.e. if students are applying for graduate credits, a bachelorâ€™s degree transcript
must be submitted) or completed coursework.
Admissions Requirements
Once the application and processing fee are received, applicants are notified of their
acceptance and may register for classes during the appropriate registration period.
Information about registration is continually updated online.
After successful completion of 15 semester credits at Capitol Technology University,
non-degree students must complete the admissions procedure for degree seeking
status, or receive approval for continued non-degree status from the dean of
academics.
