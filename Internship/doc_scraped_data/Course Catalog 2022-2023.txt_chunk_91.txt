Student learning outcomes reflect differences in course delivery methods, type of
instruction and interaction, degree of supervision, measurements of student work,
academic disciplines and degree levels.
All credit-bearing courses with the exception of doctoral dissertation research, writing
and presentation courses require syllabi, which will include the number of credit hours,
class meeting times and approximate schedule of required assignments.
