Under the quantitative component of the financial aid satisfactory academic progress
standard, an undergraduate student must successfully complete coursework within a
certain time frame. Charts showing the minimum number of credits students must earn
each enrollment period and year of study are listed in the guidelines on the university
website. Incomplete, repeated courses and courses with a grade of “W” are counted
in the qualitative standard. Incomplete grades will become “F” if not resolved within
30 days of the next semester start. Additionally, for an undergraduate student, the
time frame cannot exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in
academic years or credit hours attempted, as determined by the university. For instance,
if the published length of a student’s academic program is 120 credit hours, the
maximum period must not exceed 180 (120 x 1.5) attempted hours.
To be in compliance, students must complete their credit hours as listed in the
guidelines above.
Failure to meet these standards will place a student on financial aid warning for one
semester. The Financial Aid Office will notify students in writing when placed on warning
