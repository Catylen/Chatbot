Under a Chair, a student will further research the future demands in the Aviation
Maintenance field and how these influence specific research questions. Data collection
and applications will be central to evaluating the needs of Aviation Maintenance
research in the short, medium and long term. The literature review will be more specific
in focus and direction at this stage. The ARB will be completed at this stage. (6)
AMM-725 - Aviation Maintenance Research & Data Collect
The student will produce a proposal for research that is comprehensive in detail and
planning. The proposal will address the research topic, scope and aims, objectives and
include a timing plan. The student will then complete the research milestones according
to the proposal and research plan. The IRB will need to be completed by this stage. (6)
