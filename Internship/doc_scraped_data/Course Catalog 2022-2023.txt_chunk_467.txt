Cyber Analytics (MS)
The Master of Science in Cyber Analytics is designed to meet the needs of government,
industry and non-profits to evaluate the statistical data generated by their computing
infrastructure to determine the state of the organization’s security posture on an
ongoing basis. These statistics are often referred to generically as Big Data, but the
reality is this information must be combined with relevant facts specific to the entity
such as competitors, market position and socio-political factors to determine the threat
landscape. This program combines a strong foundation in cybersecurity with hands-on
project-based coursework providing analytic experience that can be applied to a wide
range of growing concerns.
