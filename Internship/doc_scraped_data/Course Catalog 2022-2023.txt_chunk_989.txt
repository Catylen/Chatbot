addition, MATLAB techniques for solving problems by means of calculus and differential
equations are introduced. Successful completion of this course will enable students
to begin the study of more advanced topics such as the statics and dynamics classes
taken by most engineering majors. Prerequisites: MA-261 and MA-230. (3-0-3)
