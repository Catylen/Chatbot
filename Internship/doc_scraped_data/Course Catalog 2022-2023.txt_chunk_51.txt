CAPITOL TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY

General Information

Preferring a title and an environment that would better suit the evolving institution, the
Board of Trustees changed the schoolâ€™s name to Capitol College. Along with the name
change came a plan to offer more degrees in engineering and management, build
on-campus housing, and convert from a quarterly academic calendar to a semester
system.
