CS-713 - Design of Cloud Networks & Services
This course will help students understand the design and architecture of networks and
network services that enable the delivery of business-grade cloud services. Students
will understand how virtualized data-center infrastructure lays the groundwork for
cloud-based services, automated self-service portals, how to classify cloud services
and deployment models, and understand the actors in the cloud ecosystem. Students
will review the elements, requirements, challenges, and opportunities associated
with network services in the cloud, optimize data centers via network segmentation,
virtualization-aware networks, virtual network services, and service overlays, and
systematically secure cloud services. Students will learn about the crucial role
of organizations such as Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
(FedRAMP), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud Security
Alliance (CSA), and the International Standards Organization (ISO) in creating standards.
