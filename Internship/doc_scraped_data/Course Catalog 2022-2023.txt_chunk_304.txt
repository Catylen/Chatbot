reliable and simplified systems. Students gain a foundation in circuit design and
analysis, systems and control engineering, and develop an understanding of complex
mechatronic and robotics systems. Students complete courses in robotics systems
engineering and analysis, digital electronics, control theory, power systems engineering,
and automation systems design, which enable them to build and design integrated
systems. All students will complete a capstone in which they propose, design, build, test
and deliver a computer-based system.
