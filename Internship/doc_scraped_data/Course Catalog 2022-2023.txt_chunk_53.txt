Space Flight Operations Training Center (SFOTC)
The SFOTC, formerly the Space Operations Institute (SOI), was established at Capitol
in 2003 with a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The SOI provides support for educational programs that prepare students for careers
in the aerospace industry. Through the SOI and its resources, students gain experience
in satellite mission operations and planning, and in developing and operating a
picosatellite ground system.
In 2017, the Space Flight Operations Training Center (SFOTC) was established as part
of the SOI, with sponsorship from the Hammers Company. This unique resource utilizes
state-of-the-art flight simulation and telemetry software, enabling students to gain
hands-on training in real time.
Students enrolled at Capitol may apply for an industry sponsored or internal university
SOI internship. Industry sponsored student interns work at NASA, the employerâ€™s facility,
or on campus. The SOI interns have worked on the James Webb Telescope at the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland among other missions.
