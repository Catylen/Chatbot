Course focus is predominantly on prescriptive analytics with some parts focused on
predictive analytics. Topics include operations research techniques and their application
to decision making such as mathematical optimization, networks modeling, stochastic
modeling, and multi-objective modeling. Other topics such as PERT, CPM, computer
simulation, decision analysis using decision trees and quantitative value functions,
and heuristic methods are covered, as well as use of contemporary computer software
for problem solving. In particular, the course will extensively use MS Excel for solving
the decision-making problems. Case-study approach to problem solving is used.
Recommended prerequisite: Undergraduate statistics or SM-525. (3)
