MOU we will accept up to 12 credits.
For research-based doctoral programs, up to 42 credits of graduate-level work will be
considered for transfer, with up to six of these credits being masterâ€™s level coursework.
For those that have completed a doctorate degree, regardless of when, 42 credits may
be transferred on the research degree.
Students having qualifications from outside the USA and having studied for a doctorate
degree but not completed they will need two years full time or 3 years part-time to
qualify for 42 credit transfer as many universities do not have classes for credit.
Traditionally European/UK PhD are three years full time as a minimum. If the Doctorate
degree is from Europe or the UK style they will unlikely have a transcript; their degree
awarded certificate will be used, 42 credits transferred, and this decision will be
approved by the VPAA.
