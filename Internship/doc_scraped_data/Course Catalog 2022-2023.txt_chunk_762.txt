DS-289 - Data Integration
The integration of data from multiple disparate sources is becoming increasingly
important in modern data-intensive applications. Students in this course will learn
about the principles and practices of data integration, including relational, knowledgebased, graph-based, and probabilistic approaches. Studentsâ€™ understanding of both
theoretical and practical underpinnings will be enhanced by carefully crafted data
integration assignments. Each student will work in a team to solve a real-world data
integration problem. Following the completion of this course, students should be able
to design, implement, and evaluate data integration solutions for use in data-intensive
applications. (3)
DSM-802 - Fundamentals of Doctoral Learning
Students of doctoral level programs are taught the ability to create knowledge through
original research in their areas of specialization. This course will orient new doctoral
students to learning, researching, and writing, and prepare them for the entire program
of study. Students will be introduced to critical thinking skills necessary for doctoral
research. Students will be introduced to the standards of ethical research. (6)
