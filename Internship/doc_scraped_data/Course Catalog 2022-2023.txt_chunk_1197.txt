This course combines the science of data visualization for Unmanned and Autonomous
Systems (UAS) with the art of graphic design to help you communicate complex
information more accurately and effectively. By transforming UAS data sets into
visual graphics—such as charts, bar graphs, scatterplots, and heatmaps—you can
make complex ideas more easily accessible and understandable. Through hands-on
exercises, students will explore the many types of data in use today, learn how people
perceive different graphical displays, and create visual presentations that make a
stronger impact on your audience. Students will learn how to translate simple and
complex data into effective visual displays, communicate more precisely by pinpointing
the most relevant information, and apply effective methods for analyzing, presenting,
and using statistical data. Students will also learn to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of different data visualization approaches and avoid creating misleading
representations of data—and being misled by others. Prerequisite: UAS-420. (3-0-3)
