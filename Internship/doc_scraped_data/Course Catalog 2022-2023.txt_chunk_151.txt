Refund Policy

Dropping or Withdrawing from Classes
It is the studentsâ€™ responsibility to officially drop any class in which they are enrolled.
This includes situations in which the student never attended the first class meeting.
Never attending or ceasing to attend classes does not constitute an official withdrawal
or relieve students of their financial obligation to Capitol Technology University.

Tuition/Financial Aid

Students who are reimbursed by their employers must pay in full or use the
undergraduate deferred payment plan.

Refunds are computed according to the following schedule and are a percentage based
on the full tuition amount for each course. The percentage listed equates to the student
refund in the event the balance was paid in full before the start of class. Students on
company contract may be personally responsible for the balance of their tuition, in the
event their company only pays for completed courses.
Please refer to the published semester and term calendars or online for specific dates
of refunds.
