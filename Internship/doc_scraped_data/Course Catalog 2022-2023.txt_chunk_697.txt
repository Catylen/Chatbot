This advanced course will equip the student with the necessary skills to solve complex
problems and design solutions using Big Data. The student will be able to gain an
understanding of how to design databases to manage large volumes of data, and
how that data can be analyzed and translated into meaningful results. The student
will be introduced to the field of Analytics, gain an understanding of Enterprise Data
Warehousing models, be introduced to Data Mining techniques and tools used
for mining the data warehouse, and build specific Data Marts. The student will be
introduced to predictive analysis, and will be expected to develop models to extract
data, perform trend analysis, establish patterns, and make projections. CS-511
recommended. (3)
