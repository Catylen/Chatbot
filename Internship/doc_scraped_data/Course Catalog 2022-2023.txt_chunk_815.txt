Amplifier theory. Analysis of circuits in small signal operation, equivalent circuit
models, frequency response and Bode plots. Cascaded stages with direct, capacitor
and transformer coupling of amplifier stages, loads and signal sources. Analysis
of power transfer, efficiency, thermal effects, and distortion of amplifier circuits in
large signal operation, amplifier operating classes and push-pull amplifier circuits.
Operational Amplifier applications. Regulators. Oscillators: Wein Bridge, RC phase shift,
Hartley, Colpitts, Clapp, Negative resistance and crystal types. MATLAB Part III: using
Simscape Electronics for modeling integrated circuits such as operational amplifiers.
