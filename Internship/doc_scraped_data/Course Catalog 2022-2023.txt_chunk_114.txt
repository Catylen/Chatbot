Academic Policies

Academic Suspension

Disciplinary Dismissal
The continued enrollment of any student is dependent upon proper conduct. Failure
to comply with the university’s regulations, or conduct deemed by the faculty as
inconsistent with general good order, is regarded as sufficient cause for irreversible
dismissal. The university reserves the right to terminate a student’s enrollment at any
time for cause. Students dismissed from the university are not relieved of their financial
obligations. Students who are dismissed for academic dishonesty or other breaches of
student conduct will not be considered for readmission.
