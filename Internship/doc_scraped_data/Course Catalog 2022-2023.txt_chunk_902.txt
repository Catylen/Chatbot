This course follows the protocol education provided in IAE-250 with a more detailed
and practical look at secure transactions and correspondence, as well as protection of
data in storage. Within the confines of the ISO-OSI model, this course discusses data
communication with emphasis on the security available at the layers, secure sockets
layer, and both wired and wireless security topics. One-way message digests/hashes
and encryption history and protocols are explored in-depth. Topics include virtual private
networks, one-way hashes/message digests, digital signatures, secret-key and public
key cryptography processes and algorithms. Prerequisite: IAE-250 and CT-152. (3-0-3)
NOTE: Students enrolled in this course incur an additional lab fee of $100.
IAE-335 - Advanced Secure Data Communications
In todayâ€™s world it is nearly impossible to not be connected in one way shape or form to
the Internet. Students will be introduced to multiple methods of secure communication
using the Internet and how to minimize the impact of being tracked. In addition,
Students will be introduced to methods, tools, techniques, and tricks on how to remain
