programmer faces including, but not limited to, common code security weaknesses and
modern security threats. The course explores core secure coding principles, strategies,
coding techniques, and tools that aid programmers in developing more resilient and
robust code. Students will develop and analyze C language code that demonstrates
mastery of these secure coding principles. The course will also rely on industry
standards and best practices such as SEI-CERT coding standards and OWASP top 10
web application security risks. Prerequisite: Permission for graduate students. (3)
CS-604 - Accelerated and Parallel Computing
Many of the key emerging application areas of computing such as artificial intelligence,
machine learning, blockchain applications and cryptographic systems are dependent on
accelerated and highly parallelized computing systems and architectures. Current and
future application advances will require such technologies as graphics processing units
(GPUs) and other parallel chip and system architectures. In this course students will
learn the underlying concepts and architectures of parallel and accelerated computing
