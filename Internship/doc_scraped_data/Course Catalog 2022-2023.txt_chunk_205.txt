prerequisites for courses in which they intend to enroll. Concurrent enrollment is
considered a non-degree-seeking status, so the student will not be accepted into a
specific degree program. If the student wants to apply for degree-seeking status after
high school graduation, the student must complete the application requirements for a
first-time, full-time freshman, outlined on page 55 of this catalog, and should do so as
far in advance of the proposed start term as possible.
Concurrent students who want to enroll in MA-114 or EN-101 may be required to
complete a skills assessment test. Applicants who are not eligible to transfer college
level math or English credits must take placement tests. Applicants with experience in
computer programming who are not eligible to transfer college level credits in computer
science are encouraged to take placement testing, those who choose not to take
placement testing will register for CS-100. Applicants with experience in cybersecurity
who are not eligible to transfer college level credits in cybersecurity are encouraged to
take placement testing, those who choose not to take placement testing will register for
IAE-201.
