SAF-620 - Advanced Hazardous Materials

(MSDs), repetitive motion injuries and whole-body vibration (WBV) will be examined.
The knowledge and skills to perform ergonomic job task analyses, devise injury
prevention strategies, and develop and implement innovative solutions will be included.
Prerequisite: SAF-600. (3)
SAF-650 - Specific Construction Hazards
This course examines safety programs, training and competencies for specific
construction hazards, such as excavation and trenching, heavy equipment operation,
fall protection, fire prevention and protection, emergency management, fleet safety,
hazardous energy control, cranes and rigging, mechanical and structural strength of
materials, welding/hot work and industrial hygiene monitoring of work tasks with a
high risk of exposure. Responding to unanticipated hazards due to changes in project
timelines, sequence of events, and the fast pace of some construction projects will
be discussed. Risk management and hazard control processes related to fall, struck
by, caught in/between, and electrical injuries are integrated into the discussion.
Prerequisite: None. (3)
