Requirements analysis is crucial to avoid failure of a system or project. The
requirements should be well documented, measurable, verifiable, plausible to fulfill, easy
to keep track of and precise. Students will learn to identify stakeholders and elucidate
needed information from them to formulate software requirement specification
agreements. They will learn how to perform goal modeling, software prototyping,
and use case development, so that they can identify and document Architectural
Requirements, Structural Requirements, Behavioral Requirements, Functional
Requirements, Performance Requirements, and Derived Requirements, amongst others.
They will also examine the resources and skill sets needed to support the requirements.
