The student will research the future demands on a regional, national, and global level
and how these influence the specific research questions and demands. Data collection
and applications will be core to evaluating the needs of aviation on the short, medium,
and long term. (6)
AVT-830 - Strategies for Aeronautical Sci
The student will undertake a robust and comprehensive analysis of the strategies for
preparation, protection, and resilience of Aviation. Students will be introduced to the
influences of economic and politics that dictate aviation planning based upon nontechnical aspects to requirements. For example, how noise pollution dictates design
and efficiency and even operational usage. (6)
AVT-840 - Aeronautical Sci Research Proposal
The student will produce a proposal for research that is comprehensive in detail and
planning. The proposal will address the research topic, scope and aims, objectives and a
timing plan. The doctoral student will then complete the research milestones according
to the proposal and research plan. (6)
AVT- 900 - Aeronautical Science Doctoral Writing I
The student will compose and complete Chapters 1 and 2 within the boundaries of the
