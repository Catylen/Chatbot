One of the major ways in which games are marketed to consumers is the convention.
Shows like the Tokyo Game Show, PAX and E3 attract audiences ranging from 60,000
- 300,000 and serve as one of the best opportunities for game studios to generate
excitement and favorable word-of-mouth for upcoming projects. Successfully executing
a company presence at one of these shows requires a working understanding of
budgeting, goal-setting, demo creation, logistics, staffing, merchandising, and ROI
evaluation, all topics covered in this course. Prerequisites: GDV-101 and Sophomore
