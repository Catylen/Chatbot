Continuation of Digital Design I. Students explore larger-scale digital arithmetic and
logic development using VHDL and a current FPGA development board. Students design
and build circuits according to design objectives in two parts: students design, compile
and verify their circuits using timing simulation on computers; then build and test
circuits for upload to an FPGA. Final project involves design, assembly and testing of a
VHDL-based system. Prerequisite: EE-304. Offered during spring semester only. (2-2-3)
EE-359 - High-Frequency Circuit Design
Students are taught to design, build and test microwave amplifiers using S-parameters
and Smith Charts in conjunction with modern circuit design and simulation software.
Both bipolar and field effect transistors are used to design amplifiers to specifications
regarding signal flow gain, noise figure and intercept point. Students fabricate
microstrip circuit boards using an in-house milling machine and then test the completed
amplifiers in the laboratory. Actual and simulated results are presented. Prerequisite:
EE-309. (2-2-3)
