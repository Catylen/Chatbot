Undergraduate Admissions
Degree-Seeking Students First-Time, Full-Time Freshman
A first-time, full-time freshman is defined as any applicant who has graduated from
high school within one year of the proposed entrance term and is entering Capitol
Technology University on a full-time basis. A full-time student must carry 12 or more
credits per semester.
All Bachelor of Science degrees require a minimum of 27 credits at the 300-level or
above. For descriptions of required courses, see courses beginning on page 211. All
degree-seeking undergraduate students are required to take courses in humanities
and the social sciences to broaden their understanding of professional and ethical
responsibilities within a global context.

1. File a formal application for admission as far in advance of the proposed
entrance date as possible. An application for admission can be obtained from the
Office of Admissions or online.
2. Enclose a $25 nonrefundable admissions processing fee with the application.
(Applications remain on file for one academic year.) The application fee is waived
for those students submitting electronic applications through the university
website.
