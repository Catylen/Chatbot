Project V is the Capstone project. This project provides an opportunity for students
to undertake an extensive piece of academic writing based on original research
conducted by the student. The research will be supervised by a faculty member and
must be defended through oral examination. The thesis is a medium to demonstrate
the student’s understanding of research methods as applied to a topic of the student’s
selection. Students may also use this class to begin the prospectus for doctoral studies.
