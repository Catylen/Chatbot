This course prepares students to participate in national and international cyber
competitions. Two competition archetypes are explored in detail: Capture The Flag
(CTF) and Jeopardy. Students will gain practical experience in these competition
archetypes, as well as specific competition subtypes, through a rigorous schedule of
hands-on challenges, laboratory exercises, and full-scale competitions. This course
will explore strategies of game play within the competition archetypes, review the skills
necessary to compete in cyber competitions, as well as the cognitive science that
empowers competitions as learning devices. Individual classes will be a mixture of
lecture, laboratory exercises, as well as puzzle solving. The course will conclude with
students participating in a real cyber competition. Prerequisites: IAE-201 and IAE-250
(formerly IAE-301). (3-0-3)
