CS-351 - Assembly Language Programming
This course introduces the student to assembly language, specifically which is used
with the Intel 80x86 computer architecture. Topics include data representation,
branching and looping, procedures, string operation, bit manipulation and macros.
Secure coding techniques will be taught by exploring integer overflow and buffer
overflow attacks. By learning how to write in assembly language, the student will
better understand how programs are executed in a computer and how to optimize
performance of programs written in high-level languages, such as C++. The student will
be assigned programming projects as homework. Prerequisite: CS-130 or CS-150 (3-0-3)
CS-356 - Dynamic Web Page Development
This course teaches the student how to generate dynamic web pages using data from
a database. The course begins with an overview of the C# programming language and
object-orientation. Using ASP.NET, this course explores the processing of web forms
and controls, state management, validation and error handling, SQL database access
and secure web site coding. Programming projects, including a group project, are
