This course provides an overview of the principles used in the design and operation
of unmanned and autonomous systems (UAS) to support applications in air, ground,
water, and space environments. The platform, sensors, power plant, control, and
communications systems that are required in unmanned and autonomous systems will
be explored with respect to function and interaction. The student will conduct a detailed
examination of the components of unmanned systems and the critical parts played
in operations. Topics include component capabilities, limitations, selection, overall
system design concepts, criticality to system function, and applications in the civilian,
commercial, and military fields. Prerequisite: None. (3-0-3)
UAS-150 - Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Crew Planning
This course is an introduction to the concepts and principles of crew resource
management (CRM) in unmanned systems. Topics include human performance in
crews, communication, decision making, situational awareness, workload management,
team building, and human-machine interaction. The relationships of CRM principles
will be explored in air, land, and water type vehicles. Additionally, contrasts of manned
