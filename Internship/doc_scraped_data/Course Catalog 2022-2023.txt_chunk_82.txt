Active Duty Withdrawal Policy
Members of the active duty military, reserves or National Guard who are called into
active service may withdraw from classes and receive a full refund of tuition and fees
for the semester. The student must present a copy of their military orders to the dean of
students along with a withdrawal form to process the withdrawal.
Students who wish to receive incomplete (I) grades for courses interrupted by a call
to active service must make arrangements with their individual professors. Faculty
will determine whether an incomplete grade is appropriate by taking into account
factors such as amount of work remaining, a studentâ€™s performance in class, mode of
instruction, etc. Students who receive incomplete grades will not receive refunds for
those courses. The student must then complete coursework by the end of the fourth
week of the next term, or the I grade will be converted to an F (unless the professor has
specified that the I be converted to a C or D). After six months, the Vice President for
Academic Affairs must approve changes in grades.
Students are responsible for keeping their professors informed of any military related
absences.
