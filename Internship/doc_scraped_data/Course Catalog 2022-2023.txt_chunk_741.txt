to understand the nature of a terrorist adversary, the root causes that might underlie
an insurgency, how to map the trajectory into violence, how to counter terrorist groups
and lone actors, how to formulate counter violent extremism campaigns (including
deradicalization, disengagement, and rehabilitation of terrorists from violence), and
how to counter terrorism on the Internet. The course would also present metrics used
in formulating measures of campaign effectiveness, campaign end-states, and best
practices in how terrorist insurgencies are terminated. Using the case study method,
significant terrorism case histories will be analyzed, such as in Northern Ireland, the
Israelis and Palestinians, countering al Qaida and ISIS, as well as domestic cases in the
United States. Prerequisite: CTR-610. (3)
