To qualify for financial aid, veteran’s benefits or both, students must be enrolled in
a degree program and submit all necessary transcripts. Non-degree students are
not eligible for veteran’s benefits or federal financial aid. Certification and certificate
courses are not eligible for veteran’s benefits or federal financial aid, unless they are
taken as part of an approved degree program. A veteran will not receive educational
benefits for an audited course. Private loan programs can be used for these programs.
