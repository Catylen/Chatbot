kinematics, control, programming of manipulators, along with an introduction to pattern
recognition and computer vision. Prerequisite: none. (3-0-3)
ROB-200 - Robotics Systems Engineering & Analysis
This course examines methods of specifying, designing, analyzing and testing robotics
systems. The principles and processes of robotics systems engineering are introduced
and applied to the development of robotic devices. The focus is on a robotic system
engineered to perform complex behavior. Robotic systems embed computing elements,
integrate sensors and actuators, operate in a reliable and robust fashion, and demand
rigorous engineering from conception through production. The course is organized
as a progression through the systems engineering process of conceptualization,
specification, design, and prototyping with consideration of verification and validation.
Students completing this course will engineer a robotic system through its complete
design and initial prototype. Prerequisites: ROB-100, EL-100 and EL-150 (3-0-3)
ROB-300 - Industrial Robotics
This course will cover the principles and techniques involved in industrial robotics.
