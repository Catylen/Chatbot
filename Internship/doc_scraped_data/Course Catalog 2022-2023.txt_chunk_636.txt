The national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable
functioning of critical infrastructure. This course examines collaboration efforts among
the entities responsible for constructing physical and cybersecurity protection as well
as the development of integrated risk management strategies for our Nationâ€™s critical
infrastructure. Primary focus will be on incorporating Critical Infrastructure protection
into construction and renovation of facilities in five of the sixteen critical infrastructure
sectors: Defense industrial facilities, emergency services facilities, financial services
facilities, government facilities, and public healthcare facilities. Students will complete
hands-on Critical Infrastructure projects related to the construction and renovation of
those types of facilities. Prerequisite: CRI-210. (3-0-3)
