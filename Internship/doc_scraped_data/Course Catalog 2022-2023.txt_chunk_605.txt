BUS-443 - Marketing Analytics: Decision Making in Information Age
This course demonstrates the benefits of using a systematic and analytical approach
to marketing decision-making, and helps students develop their skills and confidence
in doing such analyses. Analytical approaches covered enable (a) the identification
of alternative marketing options and actions, (b) the calibration of opportunity costs
associated with each option, and (c) the choice of one or more options with the greatest
likelihood of achieving the business goals. With the knowledge gained here, students
are better able to make the case for marketing expenditures (based on ROI) that
companies are increasingly asking of their executives. Prerequisite: BUS-310 (3-0-3)
