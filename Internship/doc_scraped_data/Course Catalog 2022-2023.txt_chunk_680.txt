CS-501 - Introduction to Python Programming
The Python programming course will assist students with their understanding of the
application, programming, and analytical use of Python as a means to making intelligent
decisions based on the results of pulling and parsing through big data. Python is
typically used for sorting and analyzing large data files and evaluating online sites to
illustrate the larger issue of any type of research project or study. The fast pace of never
ending digitalized data and emerging technology research makes Python programming
language the ideal resource for collecting and presenting such vast amounts of data in
a sensible and easy to understand format. (3)
CS-502 - Predictive Analytics
In this course students will learn the data mining and data science methodologies and
technologies needed to implement a predictive analytics solution in a given problem
domain. The course will emphasize supervised learning techniques, but will also
introduce and overview machine learning concepts in general. Students will learn the
hands-on techniques to implement data preparation, model building, model evaluation
