Any other grounds for appeal shall be considered irrelevant.

Informal Appeal
All students must follow the informal appeals process for questioning grades prior
to engaging the formal appeal. Students must initiate their informal appeal within 7
calendar days of the posting of the grade. Should no resolution occur by the informal
appeal, the student may choose to engage the formal appeal process as noted below in
items 1, 2 & 3. The student should initiate the informal process through email or face-toface meeting.
1. Student to Meet with Instructor. In so doing, they are to, where possible, seek out
the instructor for a face-to-face conversation.
2. Instructor to Give Due Consideration. The instructor is encouraged to listen to
the entirety of the studentâ€™s case and then to consider whether the current grade
is appropriate.
3. Student to Contact Department Chairperson. Should no resolution occur, the
student is required to contact the department chairperson. The chairperson is
required to meet with the student one- on-one, to seek a conversation with the
instructor one-on-one, and then highly encouraged to meet with the two of them
together.
