Incomplete Grades
An incomplete grade (I) may be given due to unavoidable and verifiable circumstances
only at the end of a semester or term to those students whose work is current, up until
the day of the emergency, but who have left unfinished a small amount of work – for
instance, a final examination, a paper, or a term project which may be completed without
further class attendance.
When a grade of incomplete (I) is assigned, the professor will specify the work
necessary to complete the course and receive a grade, the deadline date for completion,
and the grade to be assigned if the work is not completed by the specified date. The
latest date for the deadline is the fourth week of the next term. It the student does not
make the deadline the incomplete will be converted to the grade the professor specified.
After six months, the VPAA must approve changes in grades.
In the event that the instructor from whom students receive an incomplete is no longer
available, the disposition of students’ eventual grade resides with the appropriate
department chairperson.
Incompletes need department chair approval.
