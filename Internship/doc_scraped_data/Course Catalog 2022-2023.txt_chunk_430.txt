Technology Combination Program (MS/PhD)

Courses

The Master of Science/Doctor of Philosophy Technology Combination Program is an
extension of the Doctor of Philosophy in Technology. Students who do not have the
required graduate level knowledge complete a sequence of master’s courses that lead
directly into the PhD in Technology program. The Doctor of Philosophy in Technology
is designed for working professionals who conduct research in their career fields. The
program is tailored to enable students to select a focused research topic applicable to
their industry. Coursework covers writing, citation, and research ethics in technology,
and students have the option to either undertake a thesis or publication route for the
completion of degree requirements.
