Minors
Undergraduate minors enable students to add a concentration to their academic
credentials. Students seeking an undergraduate minor must have earned at least 15
credits in residence at Capitol Technology University, with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or
higher before declaring a minor. Once students have earned more than 100 credits,
they are no longer eligible to declare a minor. A student may only have one declared
minor. No course substitutions are permitted. No more than nine transfer credits may
be applied to a minor, and no more than six credits may apply to both a major degree
program and a minor.

and C, as well as database management, algorithms, data structures and analytical
skills used by industry professionals.
