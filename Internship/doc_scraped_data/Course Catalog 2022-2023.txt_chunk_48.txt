The period of growth continued in the 1990s. Capitol College began offering masterâ€™s
degrees. The college began several outreach efforts and business partnerships, such
as the NASA PREP summer program for minority students and the Maryland Distance
Learning Network. As the 20th century came to a close, the college also expanded the
John G. and Beverly A. Puente Library, creating a spacious state-of-the-art facility with a
multimedia teaching center.
The opening of the William G. McGowan Academic Center in 2005 marked the beginning
of the next era for the college. The academic center expanded the Department of
Computer Science, Space Operations Institute, and the BRAC-funded Cyber Battle Lab.
In 2010, Capitol College launched its first-ever doctoral degree. The doctorate in
information assurance prepared students for leadership roles in the burgeoning
field of cybersecurity. Since the college offered the degree almost exclusively online,
Capitol began accepting doctoral students from across the globe. Four years later, the
institution added its second doctoral degree in management and decision sciences.
