Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been in existence for decades in the United
States. These systems are relatively unknown to the general public and were designed
to control our critical infrastructure such as utilities (electricity, nuclear power, and
water treatment plants). Until recently, these systems were connected to company
networks by privately owned IT networks based on private line technology. Public utility
companies have begun to connect ICS networks to public networks such as the Internet
as they transition to TCP/IP based networks. This trend is accomplishing the muchneeded modernization of the nationâ€™s IT networks supporting the critical infrastructure
and setting the groundwork for developing the federally mandated Smart Grid. The
ICS network transition to public networks has many benefits and risks. The increased
risk to the smart grid must be addressed by the USG partnering with private industry.
