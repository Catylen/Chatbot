AE-411 - Space Systems Engineering
Understand the basic principles and processes for designing effective systems,
including how to determine customer needs vs wants. Students will learn how to
translate customer requirements into designs for systems that provide required
performance and that are reliable, supportable, and maintainable throughout the system
life cycle. Explore illustrative case studies. Team projects are assigned. Written reports
and oral presentations are required. This is the undergraduate version of AE-611.
Prerequisites: AE-311 and AE-351. (3-0-3)
AE-451 - Propulsion
Introduction to rocket engineering, space missions and thrust requirements, liquid and
solid-fueled rockets, nuclear and electric propulsion, and propellant thermodynamics.
Prerequisites: AE-351. (3-0-3)
AE-454 - Spacecraft Attitude and Control
Analysis of methods of monitoring maintaining and controlling spacecraft attitude
and positioning. Propulsion systems. Effects of gravity gradients, space environment
and atmospheric drag. Stabilization using controllers, actuators, sensors, and impulse
devices. Design of control subsystems. Systems engineering approach. Corequisite: EE-
