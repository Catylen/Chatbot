circuits, sensors and actuators. In laboratory work, you will work on putting theory into
practice in the context of a challenging project that is at the core of a national design
and build competition. This course significantly develops the generic skills of teamwork,
planning, leadership, and communication. Conventional lectures will be given on the
theoretical aspects of these graduate capabilities. You will then apply these skills in
the completion of specific learning activities such as design project, report, testing and
prototyping. The dry run testing of the prototype Mechatronics mechanisms will provide
an opportunity for you to receive feedback. Prerequisites: EL-150 and MEC-215. (3-0-3)
