The student will focus on the study of the latest Artificial Intelligence strategies, tactics,
and developments. The student will synthesize the growing effect of technology on
current operations, international relationships, and effects on the field, and where there
are areas of improvements or failings. The focus will be to start identifying areas for
research at a later stage and explore the background. Prerequisite: None. (6)
AIT-810 - Artificial Intelligence Research Methodologies
The student will evaluate and develop research methodologies and strategies suitable
for understanding Artificial Intelligence and address the data sources, information, and
intelligence to test a hypothesis or research question. It is expected the student will be
building upon AIT-800 in refining and developing their research task and plan. (6)
AIT-820 - Artificial Intelligence Future Demands
The student will research the future demands in the Artificial Intelligence industry and
how these influence specific research questions. Data collection and applications will
be central to evaluating the needs of Artificial Intelligence on the short, medium and
long term. (6)
