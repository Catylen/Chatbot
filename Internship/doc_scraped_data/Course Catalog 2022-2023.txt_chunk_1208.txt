Includes hands-on experience with one or multiple user interface technologies. The
theoretical foundation for designing interfaces is complemented by practical classroom
exercises and the design and development of a prototype in a team-based setting using
previously learned principles. Prerequisite: UAS-502. (3)
UAS-640 - Data Analysis & Visualization
This course is an introduction to key design principles and techniques for interactively
visualizing data. Includes the review, design, planning, analysis and statistical
interpretation of data to support unmanned and autonomous applications. The major
goals of this course are to understand how visual representations can help in the
analysis and understanding of complex data, how to design effective visualizations, and
how to create interactive visualizations using modern web-based frameworks. Students
will build on statistical theory and learn advanced techniques that can be applied to
problem solving, research analysis and numerical interpretation of data. In addition,
students will learn basic visualization design and evaluation principles, and learn how
