relations. Alternating currents. Prerequisite: PH-201. (2-2-3)
PH-253 - Energy and the Environment
This course covers fundamentals of energy generation (conversion), current diversity
of energy resources from fossil fuels to renewable and alternative sources, and
environmental impact of the generation and use of energy. Topics include the
availability, economics and environmental consequences of energy generation,
distribution and consumption from oil, coal, gas, hydrogen, nuclear, wind, solar,
geothermal, hydro, biomass and other alternative sources currently under development
and study by the scientific and engineering communities. Efficient use of energy in the
domestic, transportation and industrial sectors will be discussed. This course may be
used as a general, technical, science or engineering elective. Prerequisite: PH-201 (3-03)
PH-261 - Engineering Physics I
This is a calculus-based physics course. It covers displacement, velocity and
acceleration, equations of motion, Newtonâ€™s laws of motion and their applications,
gravitation, work and energy, impulse and momentum, conservation laws, rotational
