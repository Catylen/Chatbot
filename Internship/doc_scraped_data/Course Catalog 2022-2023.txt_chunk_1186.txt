UAS-201 - Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Sensors
This course covers payload systems capable of being installed on air (UAV), ground
(UGV), and water-based vehicles (UMV). The student will gain an understanding
of various sensory payloads and appropriate applications that may be used on
multiple platform types. The student will learn to select sensors depending upon
mission requirements, platform capabilities, data types, and environmental impacts.
An introduction will be made to tools for data analysis after capture and storage.
Prerequisite: UAS-101, UAS-102. (3-0-3)
UAS202 - Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Ground Vehicles
This course provides the principles and concepts of unmanned and autonomous
vehicles used for ground applications. Students will explore the problems of perception,
navigation, communications, control, sensors and payloads, and fundamentals of
locomotion in the environments found on the land. The capabilities and limitations
will be examined and the student will be able to select the appropriate platform types
and sensors to meet application requirements. Current trends such as driverless cars,
