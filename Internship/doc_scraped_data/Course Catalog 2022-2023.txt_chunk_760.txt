This course introduces the principles of machine learning (and data mining),
representative machine learning algorithms, and their applications to real-world
problems. Topics covered include basic approaches to clustering, classification
and approximation of data functions, feature selection and dimension reduction,
performance evaluation of alternative models, and relative strengths and weaknesses
of alternative approaches. The course includes a laboratory component to provide
students with hands-on experience in applying algorithms to problems in a variety of
fields. The prerequisites for the course are basic knowledge of programming, basic
knowledge of probability and statistics, and discrete mathematics. (3)
