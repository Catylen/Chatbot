Doctor of Philosophy in Quantum Computing is designed to provide students with the
opportunity to conduct extensive and sustained original research. Quantum Computing
harnesses and exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to process information. Using
the phenomena of superposition and entanglement, a quantum computer can process
a vast number of calculations simultaneously. Difficult task that there was once thought
impossible for classical computers can be achieved quickly and efficiently using
quantum computing. Graduates will contribute significantly to the Quantum Computing
discipline through the creation of new knowledge and ideas. The PhD in Quantum
Computing program is designed as a research doctorate where students quickly
become able to engage in scholarly research and publishing.
