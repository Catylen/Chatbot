experience. The student will complete a comprehensive exam that provides significant
evidence of experience in Critical Infrastructure studies, master’s level thesis and
research project (with submission of a final report, approval by a thesis committee,
and an oral defense of the research work), or a comprehensive Critical Infrastructure
project. Students will work with designated faculty to formulate, develop, and complete
the project, thesis, or exam. The completion of the Capstone Course is designed to

The Capstone Course must be taken at the end of the student’s degree program.
