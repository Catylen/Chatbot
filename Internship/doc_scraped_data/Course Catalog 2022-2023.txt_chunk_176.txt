Corporate and Foundation Scholarships
A number of corporations and foundations have invested funds with the university
to be awarded annually to students meeting criteria specified by the donors, such as
academic merit or financial need. Students who continue to meet the awarding criteria
will be considered for subsequent scholarship awards. Corporate and foundation
scholarships are not automatically renewed.
Interested students must submit a completed scholarship application with a typed
essay on an assigned topic between March 1 and March 30, before the academic year
they want to be considered for a corporate and foundation scholarship. Applications are
available between March 1 and March 30 on the university website under Financial Aid
Office. For a complete listing of corporate and foundation scholarships and eligibility
criteria, please consult the student handbook or visit the financial aid section online.
