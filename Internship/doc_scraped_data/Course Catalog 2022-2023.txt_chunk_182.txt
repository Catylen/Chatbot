Work-Study Employment
On-campus jobs are available to undergraduate students under the Federal Work-Study
and Capitol Technology University Work-Study programs. These work programs offer
students the opportunity to earn money to meet educational and personal expenses
during the year and to get on-the-job work experience.
Federal Work-Study
Federal Work-Study is funded by the federal government and awarded by the Office of
Financial Aid to eligible students who have filed the FAFSA. It is the policy of Capitol
Technology University that while class is in session during fall and spring, students
cannot work more than 20 hours per week and must be enrolled full-time.
Capitol Technology University Work-Study
Students not awarded Federal Work-Study can consider employment under the Capitol
Technology University Work-Study Program. Funding for this program is provided by
campus departments. Admitted students can contact the Office of Human Resources
for more information. Like the Federal Work-Study program, students are limited to 20
hours per week and must be enrolled full-time.
