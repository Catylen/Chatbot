Students/teams build and test their selected designs (completed in EE-457). Each
student team delivers a tested prototype and defends its project in front of a panel of
experts. Students/teams submit a final report that includes description of the design,
realization, and test processes as well as test results, discussion, and conclusion.
Failure to deliver a completed design and a working prototype that meets engineering,
software, and/or security specifications by the end of the semester may result in failing
the course. *Note: Course must be completed with a grade of “C” or higher to meet
undergraduate graduation requirements. Prerequisite: EE-457 (3-0-3)
EE-459 - Electromagnetic Field Theory
Continuation of EE-419. Time-varying electric and magnetic fields. Boundary conditions.
Maxwell’s equations and applications to wave phenomena. Relation of classical circuit
theory to Maxwell’s equations. Prerequisites: PH-263 and MA-340. Offered during spring
semester only. (3-0-3)
EE-460 - Electromagnetic Fields
Stationary electric and magnetic fields. Gauss’s Law, Laplace and Poisson’s equations.
Solutions to static field problems. Ampere’s Law, Faraday’s Law. Time-varying electric
