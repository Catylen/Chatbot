IAE-682 - Internal Protection

IAE-685 - Principles of Cyber Security
This class explores the overarching security architectures and vectors of information
assurance from a management perspective to allow the learner to formulate the basis
for sound business decisions. Students gain an appreciation for systems, networks,
processes, methodologies, documentation requirements, recovery processes,
certification and accreditation processes as well as “best practice” implementation,
training and continuous improvement. Discussions in this course give the correct
acumen of personnel security, physical security, and technical operational security as
these principles relate and interface with information security principles. Defense-indepth principles also are covered for designing proper physical security programs. At
the completion of the course students should be able to manage an IA function and
evaluate an organization’s Contingency Planning process for adequacy. (3).
