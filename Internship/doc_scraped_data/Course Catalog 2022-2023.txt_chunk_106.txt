Repeating a Class
A specific course may be repeated twice in order to improve a grade or replace a W or X.
Therefore, a student may take a specific course only three times. Three time enrollment
is limited to a maximum of five different courses during a student’s academic career.
The higher grade is used and the lower grade is omitted in computing the CGPA. All
grades are recorded on the student’s transcript.
