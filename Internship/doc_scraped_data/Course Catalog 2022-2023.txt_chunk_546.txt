AVT-313 - Aircraft Systems & Cmp II-Trb & Aerodynamics
This course is a continuation of the systems found on modern reciprocation aircraft and
introduces those of turbine-powered aircraft. Topics covered will include hydraulic and
pneumatic systems, landing gear, brakes, environmental control, ice and rain protection,
fire protection, aircraft turbine engines, and high-speed aerodynamics. High-speed
aerodynamics includes the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through
the air to include compressibility effects, shock waves, and high-speed aerodynamics.
