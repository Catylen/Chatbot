Transcripts
Student academic records are maintained exclusively by the Office of Registration and
Records. These records are considered privileged documents between the student and
the university and will be released only upon a signed, written request from the student,
except as may be required by law.
Transcripts will be issued when the student submits a signed request form and the
student’s financial account is current. A $10 transcript fee is assessed for each
issuance. Transcript request forms are available in the Office of Registration and
Records and on the MyCapitol portal.
Capitol Technology University will neither issue a transcript that reflects only part
of a student’s record nor make copies of transcripts on file from other colleges or
universities. Federal guidelines prohibit the faxing or emailing of grades and transcripts.
Unofficial transcripts are available at any time with proper photo identification, provided
the student’s financial account is current.
