Computer science and engineering applicants who do not meet these additional criteria,
but meet the general admissions criteria, will be accepted into one of our other degree
programs, such as engineering technology, for their freshman year. After successful
completion of the freshman year, students may transfer into the engineering program
with academic dean approval.
Tuition Deposit
Upon acceptance, all full-time applicants are required to pay a nonrefundable $200
tuition deposit or $200 application/housing deposit to the university. The tuition deposit
is credited to the applicantâ€™s first-semester tuition.
