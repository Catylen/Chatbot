PRM-520 - New Products Process
The success of new products is highly dependent on the quality of a companyâ€™s product
development practices and processes. This course explores how structured and
consistent processes across an organization contribute significantly to the successful
development of products. The Stage-Gate, Integrated Product Development (IPD),
Waterfall, Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking product development models all have
advantages in specific situations. Students will learn the principles of each model and
how to apply one or more of those models to particular circumstances. Students will
also gain advanced knowledge of the software development process (e.g., Agile, Scrum,
Jira, Git, DevOps, QA, etc.) and the UX design process and tools (e.g., User Research,
Prototyping, Usability Testing, INvision, Balsamiq. etc.) to work effectively with
developers, UX designers, and data scientists/analysts. Prerequisite: PRM-500. (3)
