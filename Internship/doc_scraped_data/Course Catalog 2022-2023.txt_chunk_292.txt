Intelligence and Global Security (BS)
The international and national security threats of today’s world are multidimensional
in nature. They require professionals with a broad range of expertise in managing and
producing solutions within the scope of economics, politics, cybersecurity, and social
aspects for the private and public sectors, as well as the military, to perform their duties.
The Intelligence and Global Security degree will provide students a comprehensive
and multidisciplinary understanding of the confluence of threats posed by terrorist
groups, lone actors, para-military guerrilla groups, rogue states’ regular armies,
cyber criminals (including state actors and terrorists), climate change, governance
breakdowns, and public health threats, such as the naturally occurring biological-based
infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). With the university’s unique curriculum
in counterterrorism, cyber security, computer science, critical infrastructure, and others,
this program will enable the graduating students to apply theoretical, conceptual, and
practical real-world skills in intelligence and security studies.
