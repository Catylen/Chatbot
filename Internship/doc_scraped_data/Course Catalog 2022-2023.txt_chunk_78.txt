Undergraduate students who are currently enrolled and want to pursue two degrees
(AAS or BS) must have a cumulative GPA (grade point average) of 2.5 or higher. For
a second BS degree, the student must complete a minimum of 150 credits, with a
minimum of 18 credits distinction between majors, of which at least 12 must be
upper-level credits completed at Capitol Technology University. For a second AAS
degree, the student must complete a minimum of 75 credits, with a minimum of nine
credits distinction between majors, of which at least six must be 200-level or above.
Undergraduate students who are currently enrolled in an AAS program and a different
BS program must complete nine credits of distinction between the two degrees.
Graduate students who want to obtain two degrees must complete all the requirements
for both degrees plus a minimum of twelve distinct semester hours of credit. Should
more courses overlap than is approved, the student must take additional courses
to make up the credit requirement. Double-degree-seeking graduate students are
encouraged to consult their department chair for advisement.
