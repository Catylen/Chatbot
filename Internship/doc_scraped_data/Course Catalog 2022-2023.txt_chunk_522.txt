directly support and mentor the exploration phase of the planning. (6)
AE-810 - AE Research Methodologies
Under a Chair and committee, a student will continue evaluating and develop research
methodologies and strategies suitable for understanding Astronautical Engineering
and address the data sources, information, and intelligence to test a hypothesis or
research question. It is expected the student will be building upon AE-800 in refining
and developing their research task and plan.
AE-820 - Astronautical Engineering Future Demands
Under a Chair and committee, a student will further research the future demands in the
Astronautical Engineering field and how these influence specific research questions.
Data collection and applications will be central to evaluating the needs of Astronautical
Engineering on the short, medium, and long term. The literature review will be more
specific in focus and direction at this stage.
AE-830 - Strategies for Astronautical Engineering
The student will undertake a robust and comprehensive analysis of the strategies for
the growth and evolution of the Astronautical Engineering field under the direction of
