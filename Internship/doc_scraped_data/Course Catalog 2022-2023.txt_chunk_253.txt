The Bachelor of Science in Cyber Analytics prepares students to meet the needs of
government, industry, and non-profits to evaluate statistical data to determine the state
of the organization’s security posture. These statistics must be combined with relevant
facts specific to the entity, including competitors, market position, and socio-political
factors to determine the threat landscape. The program combines a foundation in
cybersecurity with hands-on project-based coursework, providing analytic experience
that can be applied to a wide range of technology areas. All students will complete a
capstone in which they propose, design and develop a cyber analytics project.
