Federal Student Aid ID/Pin ReplacementThe new Federal Student Aid ID number- a username and password - has replaced the Federal Student Aid PIN and must be used to log in to certain U.S. Department of Education websites. Your FSA ID confirms your identity when you access your fin aid information and electronically sign Federal Student Aid documents.
You can create an FSA ID when logging in to FAFSA website, the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and Federal Student Aid at https://studentaid.gov/
You can use your FSA ID to sign a FAFSA right away. Once the Social Security Administration verifies your information in one to three days, or if you have linked your PIN to your FSA ID, you will be able to use your FSA ID to access the websites listed above.
Users who arrive at impacted websites will be directed to a link to register for their new FSA ID. The registration process should take less than 7 minutes. Only the owner of the FSA ID should create his or her account.Â
