Women's International Network of Utility Professionals (WiNUP) FellowshipsThe Women's International Network of Utility Professionals (WiNUP) believes in doing all it can to help those within the industry with their educational pursuits. WiNUP currently has three fellowships available annually to women pursuing advanced degrees (beyond a bachelorâ€™s degree), which will lead to careers in the utility industry or allied fields. Relevant fields must relate to a career in a utility related profession such as engineering, business administration, accounting, environmental sciences, communication, information technologies.
