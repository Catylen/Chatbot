Middle States Self Study Design




Capitol Technology University is preparing its 10 year self-study report for the Middle States Commission of Higher Education (MSCHE or Middles States). Capitol was first accredited by Middle States in 1976 and has maintained this accreditation status since that time.
The re-accreditation process began in 2018 with formation of the self-study executive committee. In 2019 the self-study workgroups were formed and the attached draft self-study design was produced.  The workgroups will draft reports and the resulting self-study report will be submitted to Middle State. The process will culminate with an on-site visit of the Middle States evaluation team in Spring 2021.
