The Solomon Amendment (10 U.S.C. § 983) is a federal law that allows military recruiters to access some address, biographical and academic program information on students age 17 and older.
The Department of Education has determined the Solomon Amendment supersedes most elements of FERPA. The university is therefore obligated to release data included in the list of “student recruiting information,” which may or may not match the university's FERPA directory definition list. However, if the student has submitted a request to restrict the release of their directory information, then no information from the student's education record will be released as specified in the Solomon Amendment.  
The following is a list of information that may be released to military recruiters pursuant to the Solomon Amendment:
Name, address, telephone, age/date of birth, level of education, academic major, degrees received, educational institution in which the student was most recently enrolled.
