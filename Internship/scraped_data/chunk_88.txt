Competitive Salary
High demand also means high salaries. Data scientists often enjoy competitive compensation packages, well above average, especially for those with the right skills and experience. Glassdoor's report from 2021 placed the average data scientist's salary at around $113,000 in the United States, and it's likely to have increased since then.
