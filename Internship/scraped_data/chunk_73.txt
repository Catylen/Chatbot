Once you have uploaded your file(s) the type of document(s) you uploaded will display at the bottom of the page.
Then, click “View Application Status” at the top of the “Electronic File Upload” page in MDCAPS to view the “Status” of each document you successfully uploaded.




A status of “Submitted” means your documents were uploaded successfully.
A status of “Accepted” means MHEC has reviewed your document and the documentation is acceptable.
A status of “Rejected” means MHEC has reviewed your document and the information you provided is Incomplete. You will receive a notification from our office informing you why the document is Incomplete.
