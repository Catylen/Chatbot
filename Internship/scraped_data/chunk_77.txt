How do I complete this?
To complete the ASLA go to https://studentaid.gov/ and login using your FSA ID and password.  A link entitled “Complete Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement” can be found under the Complete Aid Process Tab.  Parent PLUS borrowers and student graduate/professional PLUS borrowers must also complete this requirement. The Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement should take less than 10 minutes to complete.
