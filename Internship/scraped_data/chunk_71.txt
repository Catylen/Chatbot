Special Circumstance AppealThe federal laws governing financial aid allow the Financial Aid Office at Capitol Technology University to recalculate financial need in cases of special circumstances not taken into consideration by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  Families who suffer significant losses of income due to temporary or long term loss of employment or the death of a wage earner, or families who incur significant medical expenses not covered by insurance may appeal for a review of the financial aid decision. In these unusual situations, Capitol will use “current year” income rather than the “prior-prior year” income to determine a change in financial aid eligibility.  All requests must be made in writing and must include the pertinent documentation requested.
