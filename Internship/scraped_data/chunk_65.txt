Program Changes for the Howard P. Rawlings Educational Assistance (EA) Grant and Howard P. Rawlings Guaranteed Access (GA) Grant grant programs


MAJOR changes to the RENEWAL process took place for the Educational Assistance (EA) Grant and Guaranteed Access (GA) Grant programs due to the enactment of the College Affordability Act of 2016.
The changes will consist of recipients of the EA or GA awards must successfully complete at least 30 credits by the end of the second academic year of enrollment and each academic year thereafter. This means that students who are eligible for either the EA or GA grant must complete at least 30 credits per academic year, beginning in their sophomore year and thereafter, in order to receive full eligibility.
While these provisions became effective during the 2018-2019 academic year, it is imperative that students plan accordingly now as the number of credits they will earn in the prior year may affect their award eligibility for the upcoming award year.
