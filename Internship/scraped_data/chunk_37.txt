Student learning outcomes reflect differences in course delivery methods, type of instruction and interaction, degree of supervision, measurements of student work, academic disciplines and degree levels. Regardless of the course delivery method all courses should be consistent in the amount of active academic engagement required to meet course objectives.
For asynchronous online courses active academic engagement includes, but is not limited to, interactive tutorials, group discussions, online study or project groups, threaded discussion boards, chat rooms, submission of academic assignments and student or faculty initiated contact to ask questions. Simply logging into the asynchronous classroom, by either faculty or students does not constitute active academic engagement.
The chart below outlines the minimum amounts of instruction and preparation/study time per credit over the course a full semester or graduate sub-term. Some courses may require additional study or laboratory time.
