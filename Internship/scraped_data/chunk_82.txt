Academic Calendars, Schedules and Announcements
New and Readmitted students may view course schedules at our MyCapitol Course Search site without being logged in.  Continuing students may search while logged into MyCapitol from the Student Tab. Upon entering, click on the guest login to proceed. No ID’s or passwords are needed. Please read the information found in the ‘Guest Help’ button before attempting a course search. Go to MyCapitol to view all of the schedules currently available and open for registration. Our online registration form has not changed.
Graduate students will be issued a login ID and password shortly after registering for their first class. This will allow additional access of the MyCapitol site beyond course schedules. You will be able to view your personal information and grade history. Also, you will have the ability to add or drop classes and make online tuition payments.
