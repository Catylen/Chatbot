Register for Classes Get help using 'Register for Classes'




To register for a new semester, first obtain a schedule of classes. You are strongly encouraged to make an appointment to discuss registration with an advisor, faculty member, department chair or dean. To prepare for your advising session, you should consult your recommended program of study.
You should determine how many classes you want to take, select a group of courses to consider taking and confirm that you have completed the prerequisites. Look for any time conflicts. Complete a registration form, which can be done online or in print (obtained from Office of Registration and Records). We recommend you review your schedule with your advisor. Submit your registration formÂ to the Office of Registration and Records and finalize your registration with the Business Office. If you're a continuing student in good financial standing, you may register early for the upcoming semester. Note that the university may cancel any course that lacks sufficient enrollment.
