“I found my information security intern at Capitol Tech’s Spring Job Fair. We had him take our technical hiring test – he passed with flying colors, so I hired him immediately.”

“We have found that Capitol Tech students hit the ground running. They have done assignments centered around the NASA life-cycle so they already know what we often have to teach first year employees. We always look for individuals who work well in a team environment and we have found them in Capitol Tech graduates.”
