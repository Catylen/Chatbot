Louisan Mamer Fellowship - The Louisan Mamer Fellowship is a Fellowship of $500 annually. Ms. Mamer was an electric industry pioneer who worked for many years with the Rural Electrification Administration educating rural Americans about the uses of electricity. She was the first woman to be awarded the Clyde T. Ellis Award in recognition of her service and accomplishments on behalf of electrical cooperatives. Ms. Mamer joined WiNUP (formerly called Electrical Women's Round Table, Inc.) in 1948 and remained a member until her death in 2006. Her generous $20,000 contribution to WiNUP enables the organization to fund the annual Fellowship in her name.
