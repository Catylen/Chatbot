Payment Options
Capitol Technology University Business Office is currently open Monday through Friday from 9AM to 5PM. The best way to contact us is to email businessoffice@captechu.edu. Please include your name and student ID number in your email.
We encourage students and family members to use their My Capitol portal account access and again stress that email is the most accessible customer service option at this time. Students should make every effort to keep their accounts current. If you have concerns about upcoming scheduled payments, please contact the Business Office, at businessoffice@captechu.edu to discuss payment options.
