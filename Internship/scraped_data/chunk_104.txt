Joshua Joseph '19 // Dual major in Cybersecurity + Computer Science
        

          Josh is a senior and recipient of the prestigious SMART Scholarship for Service program, established by the U.S. Department of Defense. He’s currently working as an intern at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) and will continue to work there for two years after graduation. Despite the fact that he’s still in school, he’s already seen the return on his investment: “I’ve had opportunities at Capitol Tech that I wouldn’t have had otherwise. The hands-on experience I’ve gained and connections with friends and faculty I’ve forged will benefit me for years to come.”
