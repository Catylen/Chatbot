The library is also home to the William G. McGowan Center for Innovative Teaching (L102) classroom, and  a conference room for small group meetings or study. The lower level of the library is accessible by elevator and a circular staircase. This area contains the stacks that house the majority of our book collection. This area features a large open space with a panoramic view of a wooded are behind the campus. There are also more study carrels at the north end of the stacks for a quiet place to focus.
