Goal III: Improve the Utilization of University Resources and Institutional Effectiveness while Expanding Revenue

Capitol will likely continue to be 80% financially dependent on student tuition and fees.  We plan to enhance our resources by expanding the range and amount of funding from other streams and aligning costs with strategic initiatives.  



Goal IV: Increase the Number and Scope of Partnerships

Capitol’s service to our constituents and sources of financial viability both depend upon participation with continuing and new partner corporations, agencies, and schools.
