“I recruit from Capitol Tech for many reasons- Capitol Tech students typically possess better teaming and collaboration skills. Their technical skills also are better as each class has a "hands-on" component to them. Seems that the continual exposure to “hands-on” allows the Capitol Tech students a safe environment to take risks and experience failures.  So Capitol students excel at teamwork, collaboration and risk-taking. Many graduates from other institutions with fewer hands-on opportunities seem to be more risk-averse.”
