Lisa Sedares '13 // Project Engineer @ The Aerospace Corporation
        

          Lisa graduated from Capitol Tech with a dual degree in Astronautical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. She currently works as a Project Engineer for The Aerospace Corporation, representing NASA’s interests. Lisa began her first internship with NASA as a Capitol Tech student and has been working with the organization in various capacities ever since. “Capitol Tech set me on my path. With my Astronautical Engineering degree, I gained a narrow view into aerospace, but a broad view of the different things a spacecraft can do. My education is extremely relevant to the work that I’m doing now.”
