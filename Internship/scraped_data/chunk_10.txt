Housing InformationHousing at Capitol Technology University is an excellent way to be conveniently close to classes and professors, as well as living and learning with other students just like YOU!
The cost of student housing for the current year is available under the business office page on the portal. A housing room reservation fee of $150 is due at the time of the student’s application as well as a $50 security deposit. The Business Office collects housing fees at the beginning of each academic semester during registration.
If space is available, a student may apply for on-campus housing after the semester begins. In such a case, the cost will be prorated.
