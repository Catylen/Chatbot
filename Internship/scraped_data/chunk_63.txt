Changes to Maryland Higher Education Commission Programs to students


If you received State financial aid (Guaranteed Access Grant, Educational Assistance Grant or the Campus Based Educational Assistance Grant) beginning July 1, 2018 for at least two years beginning August 31, 2015 and thereafter, you will be required to meet certain Credit Completion Requirements to renew State financial aid awards for subsequent years.
Renewal Credit Completion Requirements:
You must earn your required credits during the fall, spring, and summer terms. To remain eligible for your maximum renewal amount,Â  you must earn at least 30 credits this year. If you earn fewer than 24 credits this year, your award will not be renewed. If you earn 24 to 29 credits, your renewal award will be prorated.
