Matching Out of State GrantStudents who reside outside of Maryland may qualify for a Matching State Grant for up to $5000 beginning fall 2021.  Most states do not have a reciprocal State Grant agreement with Maryland, therefore Capitol will match State Grants/Scholarships from non-Maryland State Agencies for up to $5000.  Students must complete the FAFSA, apply to their State Higher Education Agency annually, be awarded, and submit to Capitol’s Financial Aid Office a copy of their State Award Letter.  Upon verification, Capitol will match the award for all full-time undergraduate students.  The award is not automatically renewed.  Student must reapply each year when completing the new award year FAFSA, submit the new State Award Letter and meet other requirements such as full-time enrollment and a minimum 3.0 CGPA.
