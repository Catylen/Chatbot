Can you see yourself here?
	
With a lovely 52-acre campus in Laurel, you can enjoy all the perks of a small suburban college — conveniently located halfway between two exciting cities: Baltimore and Washington DC. At Capitol, you become part of a tight-knit community. You’ll be surrounded by people who share your intelligence, curiosity and passion.











Housing 

		Students live in apartments from their first day on campus, which means you don't have to wait until you're an upperclassman to enjoy freedom from stuffy small traditional college rooms.
	
Housing Eligibility
All registered, full-time students are eligible to live in the residence facilities. Housing is single-sex and apartments accessible for people with disabilities are available. Housing assignments are on a first come first serve basis, with preference given to those who submit a housing application and have a deposit on file by May 1st.
