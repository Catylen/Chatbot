Prepare now so you can complete the 2025–26 FAFSA form as soon as it’s available on or before Dec. 1, 2024.
Here are some ways you can get ready:



Create a StudentAid.gov account (if you don’t already have one).




Learn about the documents you may need to fill out the FAFSA form.




Determine your dependency status and whether your parent(s) or spouse will be required to contribute information on your FAFSA form.




If you’re a dependent student, use the Who’s My FAFSA Parent? wizard to identify which parent(s) will be a required contributor on your form
